# Systematic Personal Health Monitoring Systems (PHMS) Mapping Study Resources

This repository was created to store resources related to the article titled "Semantic technologies in sensor-based personal health monitoring systems: a systematic mapping study", which is currently under review at the Semantic Web Journal. 

The study evaluates the state of the art in the use of semantic technologies (i.e. ontologies, knowledge graphs, and linked data) in sensor-based personal health monitoring systems. Using a systematic approach, a 43 systems representing the state of the art in the field are analysed based on the extent to which they address seven key challenges: interoperability, context awareness, situation detection, situation prediction, decision support, explainability, and uncertainty handling. We also evaluates the quality of the development and evaluation of these systems, and propose a reference architecture for the development of future systems.

An updated copy of the article can be found on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.04335).

## Research Papers
The research papers describing the 43 systems systematically selected for this study can be found [here](https://github.com/mbithenzomo/semantic_phms_mapping_study/tree/main/related_reviews).

Existing review and survey articles that are related to this study can be found [here](https://github.com/mbithenzomo/semantic_phms_mapping_study/tree/main/related_reviews), primarily divided into three groups. The reviews in Group 1 focus on the use of semantic technologies in the health domain; those in Group 2 review the use of sensors and IoT in the health domain; and finally, those in Group 3 review the use of semantic technologies with sensor and IoT data.

There is also a small group of other related reviews that do not fit into these three categories.

## Analyses
The spreadsheets with the raw data from the challenges analysis and quality analysis of the systems can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1CBGaYS43Ky2i--eqxNIbfgHdinqupvAUs6V5bVXWGzI/edit?usp=sharing) and [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1SVIbMidxDGlQFexG1fmJJUV94iNtarBRvyzxBxgPG6M/edit?usp=sharing), respectively.

abstract = {Dynamic life cycle assessment (LCA) integrated with digital twin technologies is emerging as a transformative approach to evaluating and managing environmental performance in the built environment. This study presents the Building Life-cycle Digital Twin (BLDT) framework—a novel methodology that combines real-time data from Internet of Things (IoT) devices, machine learning algorithms, and semantic interoperability to deliver dynamic, predictive, and high-resolution LCA for construction and infrastructure systems. The framework, developed within the Computational Urban Sustainability Platform (CUSP), addresses the limitations of traditional static LCA by enabling continuous, data-driven sustainability assessments. Incorporating predictive modelling, BLDT empowers stakeholders with timely insights into energy use, emissions, and health and safety performance, supporting proactive environmental decision-making. Validated through a case study at the Port of Grimsby, the BLDT framework facilitated a 25% reduction in energy consumption while enhancing operational efficiency. These results demonstrate the model’s potential to support decarbonisation strategies, regulatory compliance, and long-term planning in the construction sector. By operationalising dynamic LCA through digital twins, this research contributes to the advancement of real-time sustainability analytics and resilient urban development.}

abstract = {Background
Novel surveillance approaches using digital technologies, including the Internet of Things (IoT), have evolved, enhancing traditional infectious disease surveillance systems by enabling real-time detection of outbreaks and reaching a wider population. However, disparate, heterogenous infectious disease surveillance systems often operate in silos due to a lack of interoperability. As a life-changing clinical use case, the COVID-19 pandemic has manifested that a lack of interoperability can severely inhibit public health responses to emerging infectious diseases. Interoperability is thus critical for building a robust ecosystem of infectious disease surveillance and enhancing preparedness for future outbreaks. The primary enabler for semantic interoperability is ontology.
Objective
This study aims to design the IoT-based management of infectious disease ontology (IoT-MIDO) to enhance data sharing and integration of data collected from IoT-driven patient health monitoring, clinical management of individual patients, and disparate heterogeneous infectious disease surveillance.
Methods
The ontology modeling approach was chosen for its semantic richness in knowledge representation, flexibility, ease of extensibility, and capability for knowledge inference and reasoning. The IoT-MIDO was developed using the basic formal ontology (BFO) as the top-level ontology. We reused the classes from existing BFO-based ontologies as much as possible to maximize the interoperability with other BFO-based ontologies and databases that rely on them. We formulated the competency questions as requirements for the ontology to achieve the intended goals.
Results
We designed an ontology to integrate data from heterogeneous sources, including IoT-driven patient monitoring, clinical management of individual patients, and infectious disease surveillance systems. This integration aims to facilitate the collaboration between clinical care and public health domains. We also demonstrate five use cases using the simplified ontological models to show the potential applications of IoT-MIDO: (1) IoT-driven patient monitoring, risk assessment, early warning, and risk management; (2) clinical management of patients with infectious diseases; (3) epidemic risk analysis for timely response at the public health level; (4) infectious disease surveillance; and (5) transforming patient information into surveillance information.
Conclusions
The development of the IoT-MIDO was driven by competency questions. Being able to answer all the formulated competency questions, we successfully demonstrated that our ontology has the potential to facilitate data sharing and integration for orchestrating IoT-driven patient health monitoring in the context of an infectious disease epidemic, clinical patient management, infectious disease surveillance, and epidemic risk analysis. The novelty and uniqueness of the ontology lie in building a bridge to link IoT-based individual patient monitoring and early warning based on patient risk assessment to infectious disease epidemic surveillance at the public health level. The ontology can also serve as a starting point to enable potential decision support systems, providing actionable insights to support public health organizations and practitioners in making informed decisions in a timely manner.}

We conducted a literature review to understand the current technical developments and challenges of its integration in caregiving institutions. Our systematic review used the Pubmed and IEEE scientific databases, considering studies from 2017 onwards. We included studies focusing on linking sensor data to vocal and/or physical manifestations of agitation. Out of 1622 identified studies, 12 were selected for the final review. Analysis was conducted on study design, technology, decisional data, and data analytics. We identified a gap in the standardized semantic representation of both behavioral descriptions and system event generation configurations. This research highlighted initiatives that leverage existing information in a caregiver's routine, such as correlating electronic health records with sensor data. As predictive systems become more integrated into caregiving routines, false positive reduction needs to be addressed as those will discourage their adoption. Therefore, to ensure adaptive predictive capacity and personalized system re-configuration, we suggest future work to evaluate a framework that incorporates a human-in-the-loop approach for detecting and predicting agitation.}

The case study is the construction of an office building in which independent information pipelines can track different aspects of the construction process and the aggregate result can assist managers in decision making in the form of a vaster entity: its digital twin. The digital twin prototype is designed as a recipient of information that mirror its physical building and its systems. The paper contributes with a real case in which these pipelines enable continuous monitoring and analysis of various basic parameters during construction. With a varied array of sensors installed, data was collected, organized and transmitted through a knowledge graph-based system to the digital twin dashboard. A dashboard is able to allocate many sources of data (from sensors, images or point clouds) but also, it helps visualizing data analysis that could help making informed decisions about the building during construction. The paper emphasizes the varied nature of data in construction sites as well as the importance of proper data channeling to enable multi-purpose, effective decision-making using the digital twin. Overall, the paper provides a real life insight that challenges massive implementation of digital twins within the existing construction sites for an office building.

Traditional methods are ineffective at processing and examination procedures for such complex multi-sensors of hyperscale healthcare data. To address this issue, we propose a novel large model-driven approach for hyperscale healthcare data fusion analysis in complex multi-sensor multi-sensors. Our method integrates data from various medical sensors and sources, using large models to extract and fuse information from structured and unstructured healthcare data. Then, we integrate these features with structured data using a hierarchical residual connected LSTM network, enhancing the model's ability to capture local and global context. Furthermore, we introduce a dynamic ReLU activation function and attention mechanism that allow us to adjust the depth of our networks dynamically while focusing only on relevant information. The experiments on MIMIC-III and eICU-CRD datasets demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method in terms of accuracy, efficiency, and robustness compared to state-of-the-art methods. Therefore, the proposed method provides valuable insights into the potential of large model-driven approaches for tackling the challenges of hyperscale healthcare data fusion analysis in complex multi-sensors.}

abstract = {A hybrid model for pavement damage segmentation, stitching, and detection based on unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) remote-sensing pavement images was proposed as high-resolution panoramic images are required to analyze pavement damage feature parameters during the inspection process. Based on target recognition, active stereo vision was used to determine the autonomy awareness of the UAV system in the 3D structure. Then, incremental search strategy was employed to triangulate scale-invariant feature transform (SIFT) point features based on geometric constraints. Perspective-n-point and random sample consensus (PNP-RANSAC) algorithm were combined to find the best matching surface for mis-matching rejection, and the trigonometric function theory was used to fuse images. Subsequently, the semantic segmentation framework based on deep learning context encoder network (CE-Net) was employed to train suitable models to simultaneously detect and segment pavement damages. Finally, the stitching technique and hue, saturation, value (HSV) segmentation technique were combined to obtain the feature parameters to be detected. This method achieved fast and accurate stitching, feature parameter segmentation, and pavement health condition assessment of long-threaded pavement disease image datasets. The splicing accuracy rate and the global feature segmentation overlap rate were greater than 84% and 80%, respectively. The experimental data show that the method is able to detect full-width pavement breakage parameters better than existing optical sensor-based automotive or drone inspection methods.}

However, the data collected by various sensors in it are user-privacy-related information. Once the individuals’ privacy is subjected to attacks, it can potentially cause serious hazards. For this reason, a feasible solution built upon the compression-encryption architecture is proposed. In this scheme, we design an Adaptive Sparse Basis Compressive Sensing (ASB-CS) model by leveraging Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) manipulation, while performing a rigorous proof of its effectiveness. Additionally, incorporating the Parametric Deformed Exponential Rectified Linear Unit (PDE-ReLU) memristor, a new fractional-order Hopfield neural network model is introduced as a pseudo-random number generator for the proposed cryptosystem, which has demonstrated superior properties in many aspects, such as hyperchaotic dynamics and multistability. To be specific, a plain medical image is subjected to the ASB-CS model and bidirectional diffusion manipulation under the guidance of the key-controlled cipher flows to yield the corresponding cipher image without visual semantic features. Ultimately, the simulation results and analysis demonstrate that the proposed scheme is capable of withstanding multiple security attacks and possesses balanced performance in terms of compressibility and robustness.}

Consequently, research into automated, high-precision crack detection methods remains pivotal within the realm of structural health monitoring (SHM). Presently, scholars predominantly rely on two-dimensional (2D) image-based algorithms for crack detection. However, these methods commonly struggle to accurately locate the three-dimensional (3D) coordinates of cracks on large structures and to extract the 3D contours of cracks. To address this challenge, this study proposes an automated 3D crack detection system for structures based on high-precision Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) and camera fusion. Firstly, precise registration of images and LiDAR point clouds was achieved through accurate extrinsic calibration of the sensors. Secondly, the lightweight MobileNetV2_DeepLabV3 crack semantic segmentation network was employed to detect and locate cracks. Finally, by automatically guiding the robotic arm, an industry-standard depth camera was able to capture high-precision 3D information about the crack at close observation points. Compared with the existing studies, this study emphasizes the extraction of high-precision 3D crack features and verifies the validity of the method by comparing the measurement results with those of the traditional method, demonstrating a remarkable measurement accuracy reaching sub-millimeter levels (0.1 mm). Moreover, the study introduces a comprehensive hardware platform and algorithmic framework, offering pioneering theoretical methodologies and replicable equipment references for automated surveillance and monitoring systems dedicated to structural health.}

This is an important area of research given the rising importance of digital innovation networks and the challenges faced in integrating specialised knowledge, especially given the greater diversity, speed, reach, and scope made possible by digital technologies. Drawing on in-depth case study findings from a health IoT project involving multiple organisations and disciplines, we explore how knowledge is integrated across boundaries during the initiation stage of a digital innovation network. Our findings point to boundaries related to the digital platform’s organising vision, resource allocation, delivery roadmap, technical architecture, and intellectual property, to name but a few challenges. We then reveal five socio-cognitive modes of knowledge integration which actors strategically enact to cross syntactic, semantic, and pragmatic boundaries: Signalling, Assembling, Contesting, Discounting, and Finalising. The choice of mode depends on the perceived knowledge status (‘what they know’) and social status (‘who they are’) of network actors, which highlight the salience of both social and cognitive dependencies for knowledge integration. We further discuss the contribution of design objects for overcoming differences and distinctions between specialist actors in a digital innovation network.}

With the rise of smart homes and the Internet of Things (IoT), the need for personalized IEQ control has become paramount. Traditional systems, primarily focusing on explicit feedback (i.e., preference), often neglect the role of emotions in shaping this feedback. Therefore, this study presents the Emotion-oriented Recommender System for personalized control of IEQ (ERS-IEQ), based on the R-E-C-S ontology, focusing on (i) Recognizing user's continuous emotional states, (ii) Estimating emotional similarity between users, (iii) Collecting user's feedback on IEQ conditions, and (iv) Systemizing an emotion-oriented recommender system using a graph neural network. In order to confirm the predictive performance of the ERS-IEQ and verify its higher level of excellence compared to traditional recommender systems, a private dataset composed of IEQ conditions, users' explicit feedback, and users' emotional states was built via a human participant experiment using a climate chamber. As a result, the ERS-IEQ significantly enhances the recommender system's predictive performance, particularly in thermal preferences. The number of linguistic terms of emotional similarity has a profound effect on the system's predictions, with four terms proving most effective. In the near future, ERS-IEQ will play a role as a personal assistant in smart home automation, offering emotion-based recommendations. It addresses key challenges in traditional recommender systems, such as the cold start problem and rating sparsity, and ensures personalized adjustments to IEQ conditions in both private and public spaces.}

IoT comprises heterogeneous devices and systems supporting diverse technologies, protocols, and manufacturers. Enabling devices to communicate and exchange data effectively, regardless of underlying protocols, is key to building cohesive and integrated IoT networks. IoT has transformed multiple sectors ranging from home automation to healthcare—by harnessing a vast array of sensors and actuators that communicate through cloud, fog, and edge layers. However, the variety in device manufacturing and communication standards demands interoperable interfaces, and most current solutions depend on cloud-based centralised architectures. These architectures introduce latency and scalability challenges, particularly for resource-constrained IoT devices that often struggle to communicate with the cloud due to limited resources. This paper addresses network interoperability at the IoT edge level, focusing on resource-efficient communication by integrating Wi-Fi and Bluetooth, two commonly used protocols in IoT ecosystems. We have implemented a network edge interoperability solution that supports effective data exchange between devices operating on these distinct protocols, enhancing the overall efficiency, flexibility, and scalability of IoT systems. Our approach allows devices interoperate by addressing network latency and bandwidth limitations, incorporating an integrated controller to facilitate broader applications and enhance performance across IoT networks. Our findings illustrate how bridging protocol differences can foster more resilient and adaptable IoT solutions, advancing the deployment of IoT applications across various domains and use cases.}

abstract = {The convergence of computational capabilities and data-driven methodologies, spurred by the onset of the Third Industrial Revolution (Digital Age) as well as their integration into robotic tools and medical implants, often referred to as the Fourth Industrial Revolution (Park, 2016), is instigating a substantive transformation in clinical decision support that is rapidly changing the economics and practice of healthcare (Sutton et al., 2020). Here we introduce the strengths, challenges, and future trajectories of computational medicine, informatics, and machine learning (ML) methods as applied in the realm of precision healthcare and wellness (Lee et al., 2018). Precision medicine and precision wellness, situated at the intersection of technological advancements in clinical decision-making methods that impact the use, reuse, transformations, and analysis of data ranging from the nanoscale to clinical and societal dimensions of measurements, is the focal point of our discussion.

We conclude with an exploration of the remaining challenges, prospective opportunities, and future directions that arise at the confluence of these multifaceted methodologies inclusive of artificial intelligence and large language models in medicine (Shehab et al., 2022).}

Although remote sensing technology offers valuable solutions, the data acquired is often heterogeneous, varying in format and originating from different sensors and sources. Harmonizing this heterogeneous data is essential to ensure compatibility and integration. This paper introduces an integrated model that combines Machine Learning methods for satellite image segmentation with semantic web technologies for knowledge base construction aimed at retrieving relevant data concerning glacier monitoring implications. An ad-hoc ontology was developed to model the knowledge base about the glacier domain. At the same time, semantic segmentation allows the elicitation of relevant features combined with contextual meteorological data to populate the knowledge base. The synergy between ontology-based annotation and Deep Learning techniques for segmenting remote sensing images enables a more comprehensive assessment of glacial health, facilitating the retrieval of specific information via semantic queries. The effectiveness of the proposed system is shown by evaluating the performance of the Deep Learning models and the consistency and robustness of the ontology in processing complex queries.}

Data sharing is one of the key factors for successful application in these fields. However, real-time data sharing through open channels may result in transmitted messages being illegally accessed by attackers, leading to privacy breaches. At present, most existing authentication schemes focus on single gateway authentication models. In order to overcome issues such as elevated communication overhead, reduced network performance, and inefficient cross-domain access in the single gateway model with larger network sizes, we introduce a multi-gateway lightweight authentication scheme as a solution. Firstly, our scheme is based on a three-factor authentication scheme of Chebyshev chaotic mapping, hash function, and XOR operation. This scheme achieves secure authentication between sensor nodes and users, establishes session keys, and also supports user key updates. Secondly, through security analysis, we demonstrate that the proposed scheme resists internal disguise attacks, sensor capture attacks, temporary secret leakage attacks, and achieves forward security of session keys. We additionally provide a demonstration of the semantic security of session keys by utilizing a Random Oracle Model (ROM). Finally, compared to other schemes, the results show that our proposed scheme has lower communication overhead and computational resource requirements, and is more in line with the requirements of lightweight device security authentication in the IoT.}

abstract = {The rapid growth of computer vision and artificial intelligence (AI) techniques, along with advancements in sensory systems and unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), have profoundly impacted various fields such as Precision Agriculture (PA). A core operation in PA for crop monitoring and yield improvement is the combination of visual and near-infrared (NIR) wavelengths using pixel-wise operations known as Vegetation Indices (VIs). However, deploying costly multi-spectral sensory systems limits the scalability of existing PA solutions. Towards this direction, Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) can be employed for transforming visual images to near-infrared representations, enabling the utilization of affordable off-the-shelf visual sensors and reducing system cost and complexity. Nevertheless, existing GAN-based methods for spectral domain translation often are limited to colorization models that produce pseudo-realistic images, neglecting the crucial spectral characteristics of the target domain. These synthetic images are commonly evaluated based on their visual plausibility rather than the spectral characteristic’s consistency. In the context of precision agriculture, such translations from visual to NIR domain may lead to inaccurate VI calculations and unreliable vegetation health estimation, making the usability of the synthesized data questionable. To overcome these limitations, we propose a model-agnostic modification for GANs that leverages the semantic information of VIs in the translation process. Our approach introduces an additional branch to the GAN architecture, calculating the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) from the input RGB and the generated NIR image. By backpropagating the additional branch loss, our method enforces the network to produce meaningful NIR representations that accurately preserve the domain’s spectral characteristics. We deploy our approach on two widely used GAN architectures, Pix2Pix and CycleGAN, and evaluate the synthesized results on relevant datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method provides accurate and meaningful translations of visual to NIR images. The synthesized images maintain their semantic context under the near-infrared spectral attributes, making them suitable for precise VI calculations, vegetation health estimation, and efficient utilization in relative precision agriculture applications.}

abstract = {With the increasing complexity and frequency of cyber attacks, organizations recognize the need for a proactive and targeted approach to safeguard their digital assets and operations. Every industry faces a distinct array of threats shaped by factors such as its industrial objective, geographic footprint, workforce size, revenue, partnerships, and the extent of its digital assets. This results in a wide heterogeneity in threat landscapes, which necessitates tailored threat intelligence sources. While some security practitioners may gravitate towards extensive sources, relying solely on volume-based solutions often leads to “alert fatigue”. For this reason, organization-specific threat intelligence has acquired a growing importance in cybersecurity defense. This work presents a complete and novel framework called OSTIS (Organization-Specific Threat Intelligence System) for generating and managing organization-specific Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI) data. Our approach identifies reliable security blogs from which we gather CTI data through a custom and focused Web Crawler. Relevant content from such sources is, then, identified and extracted using automated deep-learning models. Moreover, our AI-driven solution maps CTI data to specific domain scenarios, such as education, finance, government, healthcare, industrial control systems, and IoT. To validate and gain insights from the trained models, we also include an explainable AI (XAI, for short) task carried out by leveraging the SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) tool. This allows us to interpret the prediction process and discern influential content from data. The last step of our framework consists of the generation of an Organization Specific Threat Intelligence Knowledge Graph (OSTIKG), empowering organizations to identify and visualize attack patterns and incidents, promptly. To create this graph, we develop and adapt several techniques to extract diverse entities, including malware groups, campaigns, attack types, malware types, software tools, and so forth, and to identify relationships among them. Finally, through an extensive experimental campaign, we certify the validity and performance of all the components of our framework, which shows a 0.84 F1-score in the identification of relevant content, a 0.93 F1-score for the domain classification, and a 0.95 and 0.89 F1-score in the identification of entities and relations to build our OSTIKG graph.}

abstract = {The adoption of the European Health Data Space (EHDS) regulation has made integrating health data critical for both primary and secondary applications. Primary use cases include patient diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment, while secondary applications support research, innovation, and regulatory decision-making. Additionally, leveraging large datasets improves training quality for artificial intelligence (AI) models, particularly in cancer prevention, prediction, and treatment personalization. The European Union (EU) has recently funded multiple projects under Europe’s Beating Cancer Plan. However, these projects face challenges related to fragmentation and the lack of standardization in metadata, data storage, access, and processing. This paper examines interoperability standards used in six EU-funded cancer-related projects: IDERHA (Integration of Heterogeneous Data and Evidence Towards Regulatory and Health Technology Assessments Acceptance), EUCAIM (European Cancer Imaging Initiative), ASCAPE (Artificial Intelligence Supporting Cancer Patients Across Europe), iHelp, BigPicture, and the HealthData@EU pilot. These initiatives aim to enhance the analysis of heterogeneous health data while aligning with EHDS implementation, specifically for the EHDS for the secondary use of data (EHDS2). Between October 2023 and July 2024, we organized meetings and workshops among these projects to assess how they adopt health standards and apply Internet of Things (IoT) semantic interoperability. The discussions focused on interoperability standards for health data, knowledge graphs, the data quality framework, patient-generated health data, AI reasoning, federated approaches, security, and privacy. Based on our findings, we developed a template for designing the EHDS2 interoperability framework in alignment with the new European Interoperability Framework (EIF) and EHDS governance standards. This template maps EHDS2-recommended standards to the EIF model and principles, linking the proposed EHDS2 data quality framework to relevant International Organization for Standardization (ISO) standards. Using this template, we analyzed and compared how the recommended EHDS2 standards were implemented across the studied projects. During workshops, project teams shared insights on overcoming interoperability challenges and their innovative approaches to bridging gaps in standardization. With support from HSbooster.eu, we facilitated collaboration among these projects to exchange knowledge on standards, legal implementation, project sustainability, and harmonization with EHDS2. The findings from this work, including the created template and lessons learned, will be compiled into an interactive toolkit for the EHDS2 interoperability framework. This toolkit will help existing and future projects align with EHDS2 technical and legal requirements, serving as a foundation for a common EHDS2 interoperability framework. Additionally, standardization efforts include participation in the development of ISO/IEC 21823-3:2021—Semantic Interoperability for IoT Systems. Since no ISO standard currently exists for digital pathology and AI-based image analysis for medical diagnostics, the BigPicture project is contributing to ISO/PWI 24051-2, which focuses on digital pathology and AI-based, whole-slide image analysis. Integrating these efforts with ongoing ISO initiatives can enhance global standardization and facilitate widespread adoption across health care systems.}

abstract = {Straw burning poses significant threats to local air quality and nearby public health by emitting harmful pollutants during specific seasons. Traditional satellite-based remote sensing techniques encounter difficulties in monitoring small-scale straw-burning events due to long revisit intervals and low spatial resolution. To address this challenge, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) equipped with imaging sensors have emerged as a rapid and cost-effective solution for monitoring and detecting straw fires. This paper presents the UAV-StrawFire dataset, which comprises RGB images, thermal infrared images, and videos captured during controlled straw residue burning experiments in southern China using drones. The dataset is annotated and labeled to support the application of detection, segmentation, and tracking algorithms. This study addresses three key machine learning tasks using the dataset: (1) flame detection, achieved through a feature-based multi-modal image fusion model (FF-YOLOv5n) reaching a mAP50-95 of 0.5764; (2) flame segmentation, which delineates fire boundaries using the real-time lightweight BiSeNetV2 model, achieving a high mean Intersection over Union (mIoU) score exceeding 0.88; and (3) flame tracking, which monitors the real-time progression of straw burning with a precision of 0.9065 and a success rate of 0.6593 using the Aba-ViTrack algorithm, suitable for on-board processing on UAVs at 50 frames per second (FPS). These experiments provide efficient baseline models for UAV-based straw-burning monitoring with edge computing capabilities. The UAV-StrawFire dataset enables the detection and monitoring of flame regions with varying sizes, textures, and opacities, thereby supporting potential straw-burning control efforts. The dataset is publicly available on IEEE Dataport, offering a valuable resource for researchers in the remote sensing and machine learning communities to advance the development of effective straw-burning monitoring systems.}

The increase in digital crimes has spurred the growth of the Digital Forensics (DF) field, which plays a crucial role in various interdisciplinary contexts. DF involves analyzing digital crime-related data and going through phases such as identification, collection, organization, and presentation of evidence. As DF develops, there are emerging structural and methodological initiatives aimed at formalizing concepts and establishing a common vocabulary. The literature has proposed various frameworks, conceptual models, methodologies, and ontologies to support this area. To identify and examine existing models, frameworks, methodologies, or ontologies for digital forensics on the Internet of Things (IoT), this article presents a systematic literature review (SLR). The systematic literature review outlined methods for constructing models, different types of models, feasibility criteria, evaluation methods, and models for different stages and aspects of DF. The findings were derived from an analysis of 23 primary studies, which helped address four specific research questions. Additionally, the paper suggests further model-based assistance for DF research, aiming to assist researchers and professionals in addressing current research gaps. The contributions of this work aim to fill the gaps imposed by the practical implications for digital forensic investigators in IoT.

Consequently, ensuring secure communication in MIoT is imperative. Traditional MIoT Authentication and Key Agreement (AKA) protocols often use centralized methods, presenting a single point of failure. Moreover, these protocols can only resist single attacks and cannot cope with combined attacks that attackers might launch. These limitations make it difficult to meet the actual needs of MIoT. To address these issues, we propose an MIoT authentication protocol that resists combined attacks and solves single points of failure by integrating Physical Unclonable Functions (PUF), blockchain technology, and Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC) while introducing fog computing. Security analysis demonstrates that the proposed protocol ensures semantic security and satisfies the specified security requirements even under combined attacks. Performance analysis indicates that our protocol achieves more comprehensive security features under combined attacks and has lower consumption in several aspects.}

Digital building models that contain geometric as well as semantic information are usually generated and could be then managed throughout a structural service life. A BIM model could generally serve as a primary source of any required information on a building, including the finite element (FE) models or monitoring systems as well. The interaction between BIM and FE models is of great importance for structural engineering as it helps increase productivity and minimize mistakes due to human factors. Moreover, with the help of structural health monitoring (SHM), it should be possible to update BIM and FE models to the current state of the structure and to maintain the remaining service life. Obviously, FE models of different complexity and element dimensionality are required for the same structure in view of various structural or material limit states considered during the structural design phase and the service life as well. The present contribution describes the development of an approach that allows FE models of different complexity to be consistently extracted from the same BIM model. It focuses on the openBIM technology incorporating the Industry Foundation Classes (IFC) format. The corresponding IFC file is enriched with FEM and SHM relevant information, for example, FE size and dimensionality as well as positions and conditions of the sensors. Using such information in the BIM model, the FE model for ANSYS APDL can be consistently created. The simulation or monitoring results can be subsequently introduced back into the original BIM model, thus describing the actual structural state. The approach will be illustrated by an example of a laboratory structure.}

abstract = {Needle-type sensor, characterized by its slender, elongated shape, is a promising sensing method due to its rapid response, high sensitivity, and portability. Recently, the needle-type sensor technology has garnered increasing attention, leading to its accelerated development and extensive use in medical and healthcare, environmental monitoring, and geosciences. However, there remains a need for a comprehensive review of existing research. Here, we utilize scientometric analysis, which is booming recently, to conduct a comprehensive investigation of the needle-type sensor field. This analysis covers various aspects, including annual trends, journals, institutions, countries, disciplines, authors, references, and keywords of 136,667 publications from the Web of Science Core Collection (WoSCC) database spanning from January 1, 2004, to January 1, 2024. Additionally, we identify current hotspots, frontiers, and predict future trends. Eventually, three research hotspots are refined: multidisciplinary materials science, sensor miniaturization and integration, and biomedical engineering, indicating that further investigations may focus on creating biocompatible materials to enhance sensing properties, optimizing sensor structure through miniaturization and integration methods, and improving clinical applications in biomedical engineering. This work may facilitate the development of needle-type sensors.}

abstract = {Communication between aphasic patients and health care professionals (HCPs) is often difficult, which is even more complex for aphasic patients with limited physical mobility. In this study, we have proposed a C60-OH/PDDA/SiO2-based humidity sensor with an extremely short response/recovery time (13 ms/30 ms). This is closely related to the electrostatic adsorption of PDDA which effectively alleviates the aggregation of C60-OH and the introduction of SiO2 microspheres which increases the diffusion space of water molecules. The fast response and recovery rates gave the sensor good respiratory monitoring capability, which can be used to develop a human–machine interface (HMI) to assist aphasic patients for semantic expression. In this HMI, aphasia patients can generate different respiratory signals through the ultrafast humidity sensors to express specific semantics (such as thirst, hunger, etc.). In contrast to traditional semantic expression devices, this interface does not require the user to have vocal or physical movement, and therefore is extremely friendly to aphasic patients with limited mobility.}

In this paper, we propose a novel deep learning framework called MKNNet, which combines modality alignment, Transformer-based fusion, and multi-loss optimization to construct a unified semantic embedding space for multimodal information retrieval. Our model leverages modality-specific encoders and attention-based fusion to achieve deep semantic consistency across modalities. Experimental results on MS-COCO and Flickr30K datasets demonstrate that MKNNet significantly outperforms state-of-the-art models such as CLIP and BLIP in terms of Recall and mAP. The proposed method enhances semantic alignment and retrieval accuracy, showing great potential for applications in smart cities, healthcare, and other multimodal Internet of Things scenarios.}

abstract = {Wireless sensor networks have been deployed in areas such as healthcare, military, transportation and home automation to collect data and forward it to remote users for further processing. Since open wireless communication channels are utilized for data transmissions, the exchanged messages are vulnerable to various threats such as eavesdropping and message falsifications. Therefore, many security solutions have been introduced to address these challenges. However, the resource-constrained nature of the sensor nodes makes it inefficient to deploy the conventional security schemes which require long keys for improved security. Therefore, lightweight authentication protocols have been presented. Unfortunately, majority of these schemes are still insecure while others incur relatively higher energy, computation, communication and storage complexities. In this paper, a protocol that deploys only lightweight one-way hashing and exclusive OR operations is presented. Its formal security analysis using Real-or Random (ROR) model demonstrates its capability to uphold the security of the derived session keys. In addition, its semantic security evaluation shows that it offers user privacy, anonymity, untraceability, authentication, session key agreement and key secrecy. Moreover, it is shown to resist attacks such as side-channeling, physical capture, eavesdropping, offline guessing, spoofing, password loss, session key disclosure, forgery and impersonations. In terms of performance, it has relatively lower communication overheads and improves the computation costs and supported security characteristics by 31.56% and 33.33% respectively.}

keywords = {Weed detection, Weed mapping, Deep learning, UAV images, Precision agriculture, SLR},
abstract = {Weeds are undesirable plants that compete with crops for essential resources such as light, soil, water, and nutrients. Additionally, they can harbor pests that reduce crop yields. In traditional agriculture, weed control is based on applying pesticides throughout the agricultural field, resulting in soil damage, environmental contamination, damage to farm products, and risks to human health. Precision agriculture (PA) has evolved in recent years thanks to sensors, hardware, software, and innovations in unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) systems. These systems aim to improve the localized application of chemicals in weed control by using advanced image analysis techniques, computer vision, deep learning (DL), and geo-positioning (GPS) to detect and recognize weeds. This subsequently facilitates the implementation of specific control mechanisms in real environments. Recently, automatic weed detection techniques have been developed using UAV imagery. However, these face a significant challenge due to the morphological similarities between weeds and crops, such as color, shape, and texture, which makes their practical and effective differentiation and implementation difficult. This paper presents a systematic literature review (SLR) based on 77 recent and relevant studies on weed detection and classification in UAV imagery using DL architectures. The analysis focuses on key aspects such as using UAVs and sensors, image acquisition and processing, DL architecture, and evaluation metrics. The review covers publications from 2017 to June 2024 from WoS, Scopus, ScienceDirect, SpringerLink, and IEEE Xplore databases. The results allowed the identification of various limitations, trends, gaps, and opportunities for future research. In general, there is a predominant use of multirotor UAVs, particularly the DJI Phantom with RGB sensors, showing a trend towards the integration of multiple sensors (multispectral, LiDAR) operating at heights of around 10 meters, providing good spatial coverage in data acquisition. Likewise, the rapid development of deep learning architectures has driven CNN models such as ResNet for classification, YOLO for detection, U-Net for semantic segmentation, and Mask R-CNN for weed instance segmentation, with a tendency towards new Transformer-based and hybrid architectures. The most common metrics used to evaluate these models include precision, recall, F1-Score, and mAP.}

abstract = {Rapid advancement of the Internet of Things (IoT) is revolutionizing various sectors of our daily lives; healthcare being a prime beneficiary. Likelihood of viral infections among medical personnel has drastically decreased with the introduction of wireless monitoring platforms in the Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) network. Recent developments in wireless communications and computer systems have further enhanced the efficiency, security, and privacy of the entire healthcare industry. However, integrating IoT with electronic health (e-health) management systems presents several challenges, including secure communications over insecure channels, authentication, and key agreement among participating devices. This manuscript introduces a secure three-factor (user, medical server, and sensor device) lightweight mutual authenticated key agreement scheme (KAS) based on the Chinese Remainder Theorem (CRT) for an arbitrary number of co-primes in the IoMT network. We present a formal semantic security analysis of our proposed protocol using the Real-Or-Random (ROR) model for computational security. Moreover, simulation results using the Automated Validation of Internet Security Protocols and Applications (AVISPA) show that the proposed scheme is safe against well-known active and passive threats. Our proposed scheme is well-designed to perform efficiently, reducing both computation cost and communication cost. Finally, the proposed scheme has significant security advantages and performance benefits, making the scheme more efficient, secure, and robust compared to its state-of-the-art counterparts.}

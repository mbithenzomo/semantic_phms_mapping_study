Title = {Syntactic and Semantic Edge Interoperability},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF INTERNET SERVICES AND APPLICATIONS},

Abstract = {The Internet of Things (IoT) has transformed various sectors, from home
   automation to healthcare, leveraging a multitude of sensors and
   actuators communicating through cloud, fog, and edge networks. However,
   the diversity in device manufacturing and communication protocols
   necessitates interoperable communication interfaces. Most existing IoT
   interoperability solutions often rely on cloud-based centralised
   architectures and suffer from latency and scalability issues. This work
   specifically focuses on scenarios where decisions need to be made with
   IoT edge devices in real-time, even in situations where there might be
   internet disruptions, low bandwidth, or no internet connection. While
   typical IoT interoperability solutions support edge devices, their
   reliance on cloud-based architectures makes them unsuitable for
   mission-critical applications, environmental monitoring, or water
   quality monitoring, where internet connectivity cannot be guaranteed. To
   tackle these challenges, the project InterEdge proposed a theoretical
   interoperability model supporting hierarchical decentralised
   communication between edge devices. The aforementioned framework has
   four levels to handle network, syntactic, semantic, and organisational
   aspects of interoperability. As part of the same project, this work
   focuses on the implementation of the syntactic and semantic levels of
   the aforementioned framework. This work involves tackling the
   implementation challenges, particularly considering key issues related
   to transmission latency and memory requirements. We have created
   profiles for edge devices and data formats to store their essential and
   extra information. Using the profiles, communications can be established
   and maintained seamlessly among edge devices. We have conducted a
   comparative analysis between InterEdge implementation and three other
   implementations of established open standards. The experimental results
   demonstrate that the syntactic and semantic levels of the implemented
   interoperability solution, InterEdge, significantly outperforms the
   existing open standards in terms of standard benchmarking metrics such
   as code size, memory usage, and response latency. The contribution of
   this paper lies in these implementation results, which provide concrete
   evidence of the superior performance of our proposed solution,
   InterEdge, thereby validating its efficacy in real-world IoT scenarios.},

Abstract = {The Internet of Things (IoT) is gaining increasing attention in
   healthcare due to its potential to enable continuous monitoring of
   patients, both at home and in controlled medical environments. In this
   paper, we explore the integration of IoT with human-robotics in the
   context of motor rehabilitation for groups of patients performing
   moderate physical routines, focused on balance, stretching, and posture.
   Specifically, we propose the I-TROPHYTS framework, which introduces a
   step-change in motor rehabilitation by advancing towards more
   sustainable medical services and personalized diagnostics. Our framework
   leverages wearable sensors to monitor patients' vital signs and edge
   computing to detect and estimate motor routines. In addition, it
   incorporates a humanoid robot that mimics the actions of a
   physiotherapist, adapting motor routines in real-time based on the
   patient's condition. All data from physiotherapy sessions are modeled
   using an ontology, enabling automatic reasoning and planning of robot
   actions. In this paper, we present the architecture of the proposed
   framework, which spans four layers, and discuss its enabling components.
   Furthermore, we detail the current deployment of the IoT system for
   patient monitoring and automatic identification of motor routines via
   Machine Learning techniques. Our experimental results, collected from a
   group of volunteers performing balance and stretching exercises,
   demonstrate that we can achieve nearly 100\% accuracy in distinguishing
   between shoulder abduction and shoulder flexion, using Inertial
   Measurement Unit data from wearable IoT devices placed on the wrist and
   elbow of the test subjects.},

Title = {ZTCloudGuard: Zero Trust Context-Aware Access Management Framework to
   Avoid Medical Errors in the Era of Generative AI and Cloud-Based Health
   Information Ecosystems},

Abstract = {Managing access between large numbers of distributed medical devices has
   become a crucial aspect of modern healthcare systems, enabling the
   establishment of smart hospitals and telehealth infrastructure. However,
   as telehealth technology continues to evolve and Internet of Things
   (IoT) devices become more widely used, they are also increasingly
   exposed to various types of vulnerabilities and medical errors. In
   healthcare information systems, about 90\% of vulnerabilities emerge
   from medical error and human error. As a result, there is a need for
   additional research and development of security tools to prevent such
   attacks. This article proposes a zero-trust-based context-aware
   framework for managing access to the main components of the cloud
   ecosystem, including users, devices, and output data. The main goal and
   benefit of the proposed framework is to build a scoring system to
   prevent or alleviate medical errors while using distributed medical
   devices in cloud-based healthcare information systems. The framework has
   two main scoring criteria to maintain the chain of trust. First, it
   proposes a critical trust score based on cloud-native microservices for
   authentication, encryption, logging, and authorizations. Second, a bond
   trust scoring system is created to assess the real-time semantic and
   syntactic analysis of attributes stored in a healthcare information
   system. The analysis is based on a pre-trained machine learning model
   that generates the semantic and syntactic scores. The framework also
   takes into account regulatory compliance and user consent in the
   creation of the scoring system. The advantage of this method is that it
   applies to any language and adapts to all attributes, as it relies on a
   language model, not just a set of predefined and limited attributes. The
   results show a high F1 score of 93.5\%, which proves that it is valid
   for detecting medical errors.},

Pages = {12119-12127},

Abstract = {The Internet of Things (IoT) technology has enabled a proliferation of
   linked devices that produce a massive amount of heterogeneous data.
   Massive amounts of data from the IoT devices can cause interoperability
   issues, including issues with communication protocols, device
   compatibility, and open standards adoption. To overcome these drawbacks,
   a novel heterogeneous INTeroperable sensors (HintSense) technique has
   been proposed, which improves semantic interoperability by enabling deep
   knowledge in the IoT link layer. The proposed model integrates
   heterogeneous sensors, such as temperature and humidity sensors, that
   are connected with various operations and data management systems on
   different applications, including weather and healthcare. The sensor
   data will be organized in an identical form using the SenML model, and
   semantic modeling converts relational data into RDF format. The proposed
   model uses the Gannet optimization with Squeeze and Excitation-based
   ResNeXt (GO-SER) blocks to build deep knowledge and facilitate data
   reuse. By linking domain ontologies and datasets, an M3 reasoning engine
   makes data integration and transmission more efficient. The HintSense
   strategy is evaluated using the Cooja simulator based on metrics, such
   as accuracy (ACC), latency, throughput, and energy efficiency, and it
   yields better results than other strategies. The proposed HintSense
   achieves higher throughput of 33.33\%, 20.00\%, and 9.09\% than the
   existing techniques, such as HeDI, fuzzy logic technique, and MDSS
   techniques, respectively. Providing real-time data interpretation and
   interoperability for the IoT ecosystems, this work offers scalable and
   effective solutions for weather monitoring and healthcare applications.},

   Things-Enabled Remote Patient Monitoring},
Journal = {SENSORS},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {24},
Number = {9},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {IoT has seen remarkable growth, particularly in healthcare, leading to
   the rise of IoMT. IoMT integrates medical devices for real-time data
   analysis and transmission but faces challenges in data security and
   interoperability. This research identifies a significant gap in the
   existing literature regarding a comprehensive ontology for
   vulnerabilities in medical IoT devices. This paper proposes a
   fundamental domain ontology named MIoT (Medical Internet of Things)
   ontology, focusing on cybersecurity in IoMT (Internet of Medical
   Things), particularly in remote patient monitoring settings. This
   research will refer to similar-looking acronyms, IoMT and MIoT ontology.
   It is important to distinguish between the two. IoMT is a collection of
   various medical devices and their applications within the research
   domain. On the other hand, MIoT ontology refers to the proposed ontology
   that defines various concepts, roles, and individuals. MIoT ontology
   utilizes the knowledge engineering methodology outlined in Ontology
   Development 101, along with the structured life cycle, and establishes
   semantic interoperability among medical devices to secure IoMT assets
   from vulnerabilities and cyberattacks. By defining key concepts and
   relationships, it becomes easier to understand and analyze the complex
   network of information within the IoMT. The MIoT ontology captures
   essential key terms and security-related entities for future extensions.
   A conceptual model is derived from the MIoT ontology and validated
   through a case study. Furthermore, this paper outlines a roadmap for
   future research, highlighting potential impacts on security automation
   in healthcare applications.},

Journal = {KNOWLEDGE ENGINEERING REVIEW},
Year = {2025},
Volume = {40},
Month = {MAY 7},
Abstract = {As the global population ages, effective home healthcare solutions
   become essential. Over a decade ago, ambient-assisted living (AAL)
   emerged as a promising solution, especially when combined with the
   potential of the Internet of Things (IoT) to revolutionize healthcare
   delivery. However, integrating diverse smart home devices with
   healthcare systems poses challenges regarding interoperability and
   real-time, context-aware responses. Addressing these challenges, this
   study introduces an ontology for AAL that seamlessly merges IoT and
   Smart Home ontologies with the established healthcare ontology, SNOMED
   CT. This ontology-centric approach facilitates semantic interoperability
   and knowledge sharing, paving the way for more personalized healthcare
   delivery. The core of this work lies in developing an AAL monitoring
   system grounded in this ontology. By incorporating Semantic Web Rule
   Language (SWRL) rules, the system can provide context-sensitive
   automated alerts and responses, taking into account patient-specific
   attributes, household features, and instantaneous sensor data. Empirical
   testing in the Halmstad Intelligent Home (HINT) highlights the system's
   viability for practical deployment. Preliminary results indicate that
   the proposed integrative ontology-driven strategy holds significant
   potential to enhance healthcare services in AAL environments, marking an
   essential step towards achieving personalized, patient-centric care.},

   three-factor (user, medical server, and sensor device) lightweight
   mutual authenticated key scheme (KAS) based on the Chinese Remainder
   Theorem (CRT) for an arbitrary number of co-primes IoMT network. We
   present a formal semantic security analysis of our proposed protocol
   using the Random (ROR) model for computational security. Moreover,
   simulation results using the Automated of Internet Security Protocols
   and Applications (AVISPA) show that the proposed scheme is safe against
   known active and passive threats. Our proposed scheme is well-designed
   to perform efficiently, reducing computation cost and communication
   cost. Finally, the proposed scheme has significant security and
   performance benefits, making the scheme more efficient, secure, and
   robust compared to its state-of-the-art counterparts.},

Abstract = {The scope of the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) has stretched
   beyond manufacturing to include energy, healthcare, transportation, and
   all that tomorrow's smart cities will entail. The realm of IIoT includes
   smart sensors, actuators, programmable logic controllers, distributed
   control systems (DCS), embedded devices, supervisory control, and data
   acquisition systems-all produced by manufacturers for different purposes
   and with different data structures and formats; designed according to
   different standards and made to follow different protocols. In this sea
   of incompatibility, how can we flexibly acquire these heterogeneous
   data, and how can we uniformly structure them to suit thousands of
   different applications? In this article, we survey the four pillars of
   information science that enable collaborative data access in an
   IIoT-standardization, data acquisition, data fusion, and scalable
   architecture-to provide an up-to-date audit of current research in the
   field. Here, standardization in IIoT relies on standards and
   technologies to make things communicative; data acquisition attempts to
   transparently collect data through plug-and-play architectures,
   reconfigurable schemes, or hardware expansion; data fusion refers to the
   techniques and strategies for overcoming heterogeneity in data formats
   and sources; and scalable architecture provides basic techniques to
   support heterogeneous requirements. The article also concludes with an
   overview of the frontier researches and emerging technologies for
   supporting or challenging data access from the aspects of 5G, machine
   learning, blockchain, and semantic web.},

Journal = {OPTICAL AND QUANTUM ELECTRONICS},
Year = {2024},

Abstract = {With micrometre resolution, optical coherence tomography (OCT) is a
   noninvasive cross-sectional imaging method. The centre wavelength and
   bandwidth of the light source define the theoretical axial resolution;
   the greater the axial resolution, the broader the bandwidth. The optical
   wavelength that is employed determines the properties of OCT imaging. In
   the field of cognitive computing for healthcare, this study suggests an
   architecture for evaluating artificial intelligence based on
   neuro-monitoring. In this work, a novel machine learning approach to
   Internet of Things (IoT) architecture for brain activity analysis based
   on electroencephalogram (EEG) signal employing semantic analysis of
   brain neurophysiology is proposed. Here, a neuromonitoring system uses
   an EEG signal to determine what input to gather. The gathered
   information is processed for normalisation and noise reduction. Transfer
   adversarial convolutional architecture is used to choose these processed
   input features, and reinforcement federated neural networks are used for
   feature selection and classification. In terms of accuracy, precision,
   recall, F-1 score, Normalised Square error (NSE), and Root Mean Squared
   Error (RMSE), experimental analysis is examined for a variety of EEG
   datasets. Proposed technique attained an accuracy of 95\%, precision of
   83\%, recall of 73\%, F-1 score of 63\%, NSE of 63\%, and RMSE of 51\%.},

Title = {Accessible IoT Dashboard Design with AI-Enhanced Descriptions for
   Visually Impaired Users},
Journal = {FUTURE INTERNET},
Year = {2025},
Volume = {17},
Number = {7},
Month = {JUN 21},
Abstract = {The proliferation of the Internet of Things (IoT) has led to an
   abundance of data streams and real-time dashboards in domains such as
   smart cities, healthcare, manufacturing, and agriculture. However, many
   current IoT dashboards emphasize complex visualizations with minimal
   textual cues, posing significant barriers to users with visual
   impairments who rely on screen readers or other assistive technologies.
   This paper presents AccessiDashboard, a web-based IoT dashboard platform
   that prioritizes accessible design from the ground up. The system uses
   semantic HTML5 and WAI-ARIA compliance to ensure that screen readers can
   accurately interpret and navigate the interface. In addition to standard
   chart presentations, AccessiDashboard automatically generates long
   descriptions of graphs and visual elements, offering a text-first
   alternative interface for non-visual data exploration. The platform
   supports multi-modal data consumption (visual charts, bullet lists,
   tables, and narrative descriptions) and leverages Large Language Models
   (LLMs) to produce context-aware textual representations of sensor data.
   A privacy-by-design approach is adopted for the AI integration to
   address ethical and regulatory concerns. Early evaluation suggests that
   AccessiDashboard reduces cognitive and navigational load for users with
   vision disabilities, demonstrating its potential as a blueprint for
   future inclusive IoT monitoring solutions.},

Abstract = {Activities of daily living (ADLs) are fundamental routine tasks that the
   majority of physically and mentally healthy people can independently
   execute. In this paper, we present a semantic framework for detecting
   problems in ADLs execution, monitored through smart home sensors. In the
   context of this work, we conducted a pilot study, gathering raw data
   from various sensors and devices installed in a smart home environment.
   The proposed framework combines multiple Semantic Web technologies
   (i.e., ontology, RDF, triplestore) to handle and transform these raw
   data into meaningful representations, forming a knowledge graph.
   Subsequently, SPARQL queries are used to define and construct explicit
   rules to detect problematic behaviors in ADL execution, a procedure that
   leads to generating new implicit knowledge. Finally, all available
   results are visualized in a clinician dashboard. The proposed framework
   can monitor the deterioration of ADLs performance for people across the
   dementia spectrum by offering a comprehensive way for clinicians to
   describe problematic behaviors in the everyday life of an individual.},

Title = {An Ontology to Bridge the Clinical Management of Patients and Public
   Health Responses for Strengthening Infectious Disease Surveillance:
   Design Science Study},
Journal = {JMIR FORMATIVE RESEARCH},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {8},
Abstract = {Background: Novel surveillance approaches using digital technologies,
   including the Internet of Things (IoT), have evolved, enhancing
   traditional infectious disease surveillance systems by enabling
   real-time detection of outbreaks and reaching a wider population.
   However, disparate, heterogenous infectious disease surveillance systems
   often operate in silos due to a lack of interoperability. As a
   life-changing clinical use case, the COVID-19 pandemic has manifested
   that a lack of interoperability can severely inhibit public health
   responses to emerging infectious diseases. Interoperability is thus
   critical for building a robust ecosystem of infectious disease
   surveillance and enhancing preparedness for future outbreaks. The
   primary enabler for semantic interoperability is ontology.
   Objective: This study aims to design the IoT-based management of
   infectious disease ontology (IoT-MIDO) to enhance data sharing and
   integration of data collected from IoT-driven patient health monitoring,
   clinical management of individual patients, and disparate heterogeneous
   infectious disease surveillance.
   Methods: The ontology modeling approach was chosen for its semantic
   richness in knowledge representation, flexibility, ease of
   extensibility, and capability for knowledge inference and reasoning. The
   IoT-MIDO was developed using the basic formal ontology (BFO) as the
   top-level ontology. We reused the classes from existing BFO-based
   ontologies as much as possible to maximize the interoperability with
   other BFO-based ontologies and databases that rely on them. We
   formulated the competency questions as requirements for the ontology to
   achieve the intended goals.
   Results: We designed an ontology to integrate data from heterogeneous
   sources, including IoT-driven patient monitoring, clinical management of
   individual patients, and infectious disease surveillance systems. This
   integration aims to facilitate the collaboration between clinical care
   and public health domains. We also demonstrate five use cases using the
   simplified ontological models to show the potential applications of
   IoT-MIDO: (1) IoT-driven patient monitoring, risk assessment, early
   warning, and risk management; (2) clinical management of patients with
   infectious diseases; (3) epidemic risk analysis for timely response at
   the public health level; (4) infectious disease surveillance; and (5)
   transforming patient information into surveillance information.
   Conclusions: The development of the IoT-MIDO was driven by competency
   questions. Being able to answer all the formulated competency questions,
   we successfully demonstrated that our ontology has the potential to
   facilitate data sharing and integration for orchestrating IoT-driven
   patient health monitoring in the context of an infectious disease
   epidemic, clinical patient management, infectious disease surveillance,
   and epidemic risk analysis. The novelty and uniqueness of the ontology
   lie in building a bridge to link IoT-based individual patient monitoring
   and early warning based on patient risk assessment to infectious disease
   epidemic surveillance at the public health level. The ontology can also
   serve as a starting point to enable potential decision support systems,
   providing actionable insights to support public health organizations and
   practitioners in making informed decisions in a timely manner.},

Title = {Multitask Correlation Constrained Topological Learning Toward Smart

Abstract = {Due to the high dependence of social development on electricity, the
   failure of energy system equipment often leads to inestimable losses.
   The use of Internet of Things (IoT) technology to collect real-time data
   from energy devices and artificial intelligence (AI) technology to
   prognostic faults in the devices becomes essential to achieve power
   system security. Although real-time data contains rich descriptions of
   relevant equipment faults and solutions, the complex data structure and
   severe imbalance of condition monitoring (CM) data may lead to poor
   performance of AI models. In this study, we propose a multitask
   correlation constrained topology learning model for smart prognostic and
   health management in IoT. In particular, the proposed model mainly
   includes a feature extraction module, a multitask topology network
   (MTTN) module, and a class balance loss (CBL) algorithm module. First,
   the Bi-LSTM is employed to extract word collocation features and
   numerical features of the data, focusing on the important semantic
   features in complex structured data. Second, the MTTN is constructed to
   efficiently utilize the topological dependency between multiple tasks.
   Finally, a CBL loss function is applied to enhance the focus on the
   minority classes. Experiment and evaluation results demonstrate that our
   model has superior learning efficiency and prediction performance,
   especially on extremely imbalanced data, which can correctly predict the
   faulty equipment, the fault cause and the fault severity level,
   providing a rapid and precise reference for advance repair or
   replacement of energy system equipment in IoT environments.},

Month = {APR},
Abstract = {As the application of Industrial Robots (IRs) scales and related
   participants increase, the demands for intelligent Operation and
   Maintenance (O\&M) and multi-tenant collaboration rise. Traditional
   methods could no longer cover the requirements, while the Industrial
   Internet of Things (IIoT) has been considered a promising solution.
   However, there's a lack of IIoT platforms dedicated to IR O\&M,
   including IR maintenance, process optimization, and knowledge sharing.
   In this context, this paper puts forward the multi-tenant-oriented ACbot
   platform, which attempts to provide the first holistic IIoT-based
   solution for O\&M of IRs. Based on an information model designed for the
   IR field, ACbot has implemented an application architecture with
   resource and microservice management across the cloud and multiple
   edges. On this basis, we develop four vital applications including
   real-time monitoring, health management, process optimization, and
   knowledge graph. We have deployed the ACbot platform in real-world
   scenarios that contain various participants, types of IRs, and
   processes. To date, ACbot has been accessed by 10 organizations and
   managed 60 industrial robots, demonstrating that the platform fulfills
   our expectations. Furthermore, the application results also showcase its
   robustness, versatility, and adaptability for developing and hosting
   intelligent robot applications.},

Title = {SMART: Scene-Motion-Aware Human Action Recognition Framework for Mental

Abstract = {Patients with mental disorders often exhibit risky abnormal actions,
   such as climbing walls or hitting windows, necessitating intelligent
   video behavior monitoring for smart healthcare with the rising Internet
   of Things (IoT) technology. However, the development of vision-based
   human action recognition (HAR) for these actions is hindered by the lack
   of specialized algorithms and datasets. In this article, we innovatively
   propose to build a vision-based HAR dataset, including abnormal actions
   often occurring in the mental disorder group and then introduce a novel
   scene-motion-aware action recognition technology framework, named SMART,
   consisting of two technical modules. First, we propose a scene
   perception module to extract human motion trajectory and human-scene
   interaction features, which introduces additional scene information for
   a supplementary semantic representation of the above actions. Second,
   the multistage fusion module fuses the skeleton motion, motion
   trajectory, and human-scene interaction features, enhancing the semantic
   association between the skeleton motion and the above supplementary
   representation, thus generating a comprehensive representation with both
   human motion and scene information. The effectiveness of our proposed
   method has been validated on our self-collected HAR dataset (MentalHAD),
   achieving 94.9\% and 93.1\% accuracy in un-seen subjects and scenes and
   outperforming state-of-the-art approaches by 6.5\% and 13.2\%,
   respectively. The demonstrated subject- and scene- generalizability
   makes it possible for SMART's migration to practical deployment in smart
   healthcare systems for mental disorder patients in medical settings. The
   code and dataset will be released publicly for further research:

Title = {User security authentication protocol in multi gateway scenarios of the
   Internet of Things},
Journal = {AD HOC NETWORKS},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {156},
Month = {APR 1},
Abstract = {5G technology has been applied and popularized, leading to the
   widespread usage of the Internet of Things (IoT) in various areas such
   as intelligent transportation, home security, fire protection,
   industrial monitoring, healthcare, and data collection intelligence.
   Data sharing is one of the key factors for successful application in
   these fields. However, real-time data sharing through open channels may
   result in transmitted messages being illegally accessed by attackers,
   leading to privacy breaches. At present, most existing authentication
   schemes focus on single gateway authentication models. In order to
   overcome issues such as elevated communication overhead, reduced network
   performance, and inefficient cross -domain access in the single gateway
   model with larger network sizes, we introduce a multi -gateway
   lightweight authentication scheme as a solution. Firstly, our scheme is
   based on a three -factor authentication scheme of Chebyshev chaotic
   mapping, hash function, and XOR operation. This scheme achieves secure
   authentication between sensor nodes and users, establishes session keys,
   and also supports user key updates. Secondly, through security analysis,
   we demonstrate that the proposed scheme resists internal disguise
   attacks, sensor capture attacks, temporary secret leakage attacks, and
   achieves forward security of session keys. We additionally provide a
   demonstration of the semantic security of session keys by utilizing a
   Random Oracle Model (ROM). Finally, compared to other schemes, the
   results show that our proposed scheme has lower communication overhead
   and computational resource requirements, and is more in line with the
   requirements of lightweight device security authentication in the IoT.},

Title = {A blockchain-based medical IoT authentication scheme resistant to
   combined attacks},
Journal = {COMPUTER NETWORKS},
Year = {2025},
Volume = {263},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {The Medical Internet of Things (MIoT) has transformed the healthcare
   industry by facilitating telemedicine and real-time health monitoring.
   In MIoT, doctors can address patients' issues at any time and in any
   scenario. However, MIoT faces common data security issues in IoT
   applications, and the unique nature of healthcare services demands
   higher privacy protection. Consequently, ensuring secure communication
   in MIoT is imperative. Traditional MIoT Authentication and Key Agreement
   (AKA) protocols often use centralized methods, presenting a single point
   of failure. Moreover, these protocols can only resist single attacks and
   cannot cope with combined attacks that attackers might launch. These
   limitations make it difficult to meet the actual needs of MIoT. To
   address these issues, we propose an MIoT authentication protocol that
   resists combined attacks and solves single points of failure by
   integrating Physical Unclonable Functions (PUF), blockchain technology,
   and Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC) while introducing fog computing.
   Security analysis demonstrates that the proposed protocol ensures
   semantic security and satisfies the specified security requirements even
   under combined attacks. Performance analysis indicates that our protocol
   achieves more comprehensive security features under combined attacks and
   has lower consumption in several aspects.},

Abstract = {The progress made in the field of medicine and the consequent increase
   in the prospect of life have contributed to rise people's interest
   towards a healthier lifestyle. Fitness activity is becoming a must for
   those who aspire to live more and better. However, this should be
   accompanied by additional good practices to safeguard individuals' life
   from risks that could undermine their health. Most of these risks are
   linked to personal, surrounding, and contextual conditions that
   technology can detect and monitor. Recommender systems can adequately
   support fitness activity by performing data analyzes aimed at
   identifying possible risk factors for users, starting from their
   physiological data and those related to the closest context where they
   are. This article introduces the architecture of a recommender system
   called App4Health in the context related to both mobile crowd sensing
   and wellness. The App4Health architecture consists of a smart
   application platform, capable of interfacing and managing data from
   heterogeneous edge sources, such as mobile phones, IoT, and sensors. The
   analysis result consists of the semantic generation of healthy
   behavioral conducts to the user as Telegram BOT messages. For evaluating
   the proposed solution, the article also provides a case study and a
   testbed. The testbed consists of a comparative stress test of two edge
   software components of the App4Health's architecture in order to
   identify the performance degradation threshold of these components,
   assuming that they can be deployed on edge-level hardware devices with
   different technical specifications and configurations.},

Abstract = {Persistent air quality pollution poses a serious threat to human health,
   and is one of the action points that policy makers should monitor
   according to the Directive 2008/50/EC. While deploying a massive network
   of hyperlocal sensors could provide extensive monitoring, this approach
   cannot generate geospatial continuous data and present several
   challenges in terms of logistics. Thus, developing accurate and
   trustable expert systems based on chemistry transport models is a key
   strategy for environmental protection. However, chemistry transport
   models present an important lack of standardization, and the formats are
   not interoperable between different systems, which limits the use for
   different stakeholders. In this context, semantic technologies provide
   methods and standards for scientific data and make information readable
   for expert systems. Therefore, this paper proposes a novel methodology
   for an ontology driven transformation for CHIMERE simulations, a
   chemistry transport model, allowing to generate knowledge graphs
   representing air quality information. It enables the transformation of
   netCDF files into RDF triples for short term air quality forecasting.
   Concretely, we utilize the Semantic Web Integration Tool (SWIT)
   framework for mapping individuals using an ontology as a template. Then,
   a new ontology for CHIMERE has been defined in this work, reusing
   concepts for other standards in the state of the art. Our approach
   demonstrates that RDF files can be created from netCDF in a linear
   computational time, allowing the scalability for expert systems. In
   addition, the ontology complains with the OQuaRE quality metrics and can
   be extended in future extensions to be applied to other chemistry
   transport models.
   Scientific contributions: Development of the first ontology for a
   chemistry transport model. FAIRification of physical models thanks to
   the generation of knowledge graphs from netCDF files. The ontology
   proposed is published in PURL (https://purl.org/chimere-ontology) and
   the knowledge graph generated for a 72-h simulation can be accessed in
   the following repository: https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.13981544.},

Title = {Emotion-oriented recommender system for personalized control of indoor
   environmental quality},
Journal = {BUILDING AND ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {254},
Month = {APR 15},
Abstract = {Indoor Environmental Quality (IEQ) significantly influences health,
   cognitive abilities, and even moods. With the rise of smart homes and
   the Internet of Things (IoT), the need for personalized IEQ control has
   become paramount. Traditional systems, primarily focusing on explicit
   feedback (i.e., preference), often neglect the role of emotions in
   shaping this feedback. Therefore, this study presents the
   Emotion-oriented Recommender System for personalized control of IEQ
   (ERS-IEQ), based on the R -E -C -S ontology, focusing on (i) Recognizing
   user's continuous emotional states, (ii) Estimating emotional similarity
   between users, (iii) Collecting user's feedback on IEQ conditions, and
   (iv) Systemizing an emotion-oriented recommender system using a graph
   neural network. In order to confirm the predictive performance of the
   ERS-IEQ and verify its higher level of excellence compared to
   traditional recommender systems, a private dataset composed of IEQ
   conditions, users' explicit feedback, and users' emotional states was
   built via a human participant experiment using a climate chamber. As a
   result, the ERS-IEQ significantly enhances the recommender system's
   predictive performance, particularly in thermal preferences. The number
   of linguistic terms of emotional similarity has a profound effect on the
   system's predictions, with four terms proving most effective. In the
   near future, ERS-IEQ will play a role as a personal assistant in smart
   home automation, offering emotion-based recommendations. It addresses
   key challenges in traditional recommender systems, such as the cold
   start problem and rating sparsity, and ensures personalized adjustments
   to IEQ conditions in both private and public spaces.},

Title = {LightSTATE: A Generalized Framework for Real-Time Human Activity
   Detection Using Edge-Based Video Processing and Vision Language Models},
Journal = {IEEE ACCESS},
Year = {2025},
Volume = {13},
Pages = {97609-97627},
Abstract = {Human activity detection plays a vital role in applications such as
   healthcare monitoring, smart environments, and security surveillance.
   However, traditional methods often rely on computationally intensive
   models, which are unsuitable for edge devices due to their limited
   resources and high latency. This research introduces a new approach
   named LightSTATE, a lightweight hybrid framework designed for real-time
   activity detection by integrating edge-based preprocessing with
   cloud-hosted Vision Language Models (VLMs). The system processes video
   streams through efficient frame extraction, edge detection and Root Mean
   Square Error (RMSE)-based frame filtering to identify significant motion
   events. These selected frames are transmitted to the cloud for semantic
   analysis and state recognition. The system utilizes GPT-4o as the
   vision-language model to generate rich, descriptive captions for human
   state understanding. LightSTATE was evaluated on a curated dataset of 9
   real-world videos containing 634 frames, with 320 labeled frames used
   for testing. The framework demonstrated high accuracy in detecting
   predefined states, with an average precision of 0.98, an average recall
   of 0.98, and an average F1-score of 0.98. The experimental results
   confirm that the average frame processing time is approximately 0.8-0.9
   seconds, ensuring suitability for real-time applications. Due to the
   scarcity of publicly accessible datasets, we compiled a custom dataset
   to effectively assess the performance of our proposed approach. The
   results validate the scalability and real-time capabilities of our
   proposed system, making it a promising solution for continuous
   monitoring applications. This study establishes LightSTATE as a
   scalable, efficient, and privacy-preserving framework for real-time
   human activity detection. Future work will focus on extending its
   applicability to dynamic and multi-person scenarios while enhancing
   system adaptability for diverse use cases.},

Abstract = {Estimating and monitoring the sleep states at home using ubiquitous
   infrared (IR) visual camera sensors is an essential healthcare problem.
   Currently, the common challenge of using IoT sensors to predict sleep
   stages is the ``semantic gap{''} between the IoT sensory signals and the
   medical signals, where fewer correlations between IoT sensory signals
   and the sleep stage labels are observed. To bridge this gap, we propose
   a novel systematic and methodological IoT design (IoT-V2E) to retrieve
   the most similar electroencephalogram signal representations in a
   database given an IR visual query for sleep-related analysis.
   Specifically, we make the following specific contributions: 1) we
   collect a cross-modal retrieval data set, including the IR sensory
   signals and the synchronized Polysomnography signals with sleep stage
   ground-truth annotations; 2) we propose a novel uncertainty-aware
   hashing retrieval method, presenting superior performances, sufficient
   interpretability, and high memory efficiency; 3) our method achieves the
   state-of-the-art sleep stage retrieval results and provides the
   uncertainty for each query in the inference; and 4) most importantly,
   our system is evaluated to be able to assist the physicians not only in
   diagnosing sleep-related diseases but also finding the subjects with the
   most similar sleep patterns. Our project is available at
   https://github.com/SPIresearch/IoT-V2E.},

Title = {Integrating Sensor Data with Large Language Models for Enhanced Elderly
   Care: A Methodological Framework},
Journal = {SENSORS AND MATERIALS},
Year = {2025},
Volume = {37},
Number = {3},
Pages = {1099-1138},
Abstract = {The global aged population is expected to exceed 2.1 billion,
   representing 21.65\% of the total population by 2050. This demographic
   shift underscores an urgent need for efficient elderly care,
   particularly in home settings. AI advancements have made sensor
   technology, including wearable biosensors, environmental monitors, and
   biochemical sensors, essential for elderly care by enabling the
   collection of physiological and activity data. Current systems overwhelm
   caregivers with complex data analysis and personalized recommendations.
   Large language models (LLMs) address this by offering insights through
   natural language interfaces, using extensive medical data. While some
   studies have integrated sensor data with LLMs for health monitoring
   applications, a comprehensive framework for seamlessly combining diverse
   sensor data with LLMs in elderly care is still missing. In this study,
   we propose a novel methodological framework that addresses the
   challenges of integrating heterogeneous sensor data with LLMs to provide
   real-time healthcare insights for caregivers of the elderly using sensor
   technologies. Our framework employs few-shot learning on Generative
   Pre-trained Transformer (GPT-4) and GPT3.5 to process structured sensor
   data from wearable and environmental devices. The LLMpowered application
   then generates insightful responses based on the user's input, providing
   actionable and personalized recommendations. The GPT-4 model
   outperformed GPT-3.5 in Structured Query Language (SQL) query generation
   for sensor data retrieval and processing, achieving a semantic
   similarity score of 0.95, precision of 88.5\%, recall of 98.92\%, and an
   F1-score of 93.40\%. In this study, we explore how integrating sensor
   data with LLMs enhances usability and reduces complexity in health
   monitoring systems. Our framework sets a new benchmark for advancing
   elderly care through innovative LLM-powered applications and sensor
   technology.},

   Ontology implemented in a smartwatch app},
Journal = {SEMANTIC WEB},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {15},

Pages = {259-284},
Abstract = {Occupant feedback enables building managers to improve occupants'
   health, comfort, and satisfaction. However, acquiring continuous
   occupant feedback and integrating this feedback with other building
   information is challenging. This paper presents a scalable method to
   acquire continuous occupant feedback and directly integrate this with
   other building information. Semantic web technologies were applied to
   solve data interoperability issues. The Occupant Feedback Ontology was
   developed to describe feedback semantically. Next to this, a smartwatch
   app - Mintal - was developed to acquire continuous feedback on indoor
   environmental quality. The app gathers location, medical information,
   and answers on short micro surveys. Mintal applied the Occupant Feedback
   Ontology to directly integrate the feedback with linked building data. A
   case study was performed to evaluate this method. A semantic digital
   twin was created by integrating linked building data, sensor data, and
   occupant feedback. Results from SPARQL queries gave more insight into an
   occupant's perceived comfort levels in the Open Flat. The case study
   shows how integrating feedback with building information allows for more
   occupant-centric decision support tools. The approach presented in this
   paper can be used in a wide range of use cases, both within and without
   the architecture, building, and construction domain.},

Title = {Remote glacier monitoring through semantic fusion of geographic and

Abstract = {Glacier melting, due to climate change, is a growing concern with many
   implications for the planet. Although remote sensing technology offers
   valuable solutions, the data acquired is often heterogeneous, varying in
   format and originating from different sensors and sources. Harmonizing
   this heterogeneous data is essential to ensure compatibility and
   integration. This paper introduces an integrated model that combines
   Machine Learning methods for satellite image segmentation with semantic
   web technologies for knowledge base construction aimed at retrieving
   relevant data concerning glacier monitoring implications. An ad-hoc
   ontology was developed to model the knowledge base about the glacier
   domain. At the same time, semantic segmentation allows the elicitation
   of relevant features combined with contextual meteorological data to
   populate the knowledge base. The synergy between ontology-based
   annotation and Deep Learning techniques for segmenting remote sensing
   images enables a more comprehensive assessment of glacial health,
   facilitating the retrieval of specific information via semantic queries.
   The effectiveness of the proposed system is shown by evaluating the
   performance of the Deep Learning models and the consistency and
   robustness of the ontology in processing complex queries.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF STRATEGIC INFORMATION SYSTEMS},
Year = {2025},
Volume = {34},

Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Digital innovation is a complex process in which actors seek to create
   new value pathways by combining digital resources in a layered modular
   architecture. While IS scholarship has a rich tradition of research on
   developing and implementing digital artefacts within
   intra-organisational contexts, our understanding of knowledge
   integration across distributed innovation networks is nascent and
   under-theorised. This is an important area of research given the rising
   importance of digital innovation networks and the challenges faced in
   integrating specialised knowledge, especially given the greater
   diversity, speed, reach, and scope made possible by digital
   technologies. Drawing on in-depth case study findings from a health IoT
   project involving multiple organisations and disciplines, we explore how
   knowledge is integrated across boundaries during the initiation stage of
   a digital innovation network. Our findings point to boundaries related
   to the digital platform's organising vision, resource allocation,
   delivery roadmap, technical architecture, and intellectual property, to
   name but a few challenges. We then reveal five socio-cognitive modes of
   knowledge integration which actors strategically enact to cross
   syntactic, semantic, and pragmatic boundaries: Signalling, Assembling,
   Contesting, Discounting, and Finalising. The choice of mode depends on
   the perceived knowledge status ('what they know') and social status
   ('who they are') of network actors, which highlight the salience of both
   social and cognitive dependencies for knowledge integration. We further
   discuss the contribution of design objects for overcoming differences
   and distinctions between specialist actors in a digital innovation
   network.},

Title = {EHEALTH INNOVATION FOR CHRONIC OBSTRUCTIVE PULMONARY DISEASE: A
   CONTEXT-AWARE COMPREHENSIVE FRAMEWORK},

Abstract = {Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) poses a significant global
   healthcare challenge. It is a progressive lung disease that causes
   breathing difficulties and can significantly impact a person's quality
   of life. COPD is primarily caused by smoking, but other factors, such as
   air pollution and genetic predisposition, can also contribute to its
   development. This paper introduces a novel Context-Aware Framework for
   the Diagnosis and Personalized Management of COPD. We discuss the
   limitations of traditional COPD management, highlighting the importance
   of early detection and remote monitoring. Early detection and remote
   monitoring are crucial in managing COPD as they allow for timely
   interventions and better disease management. In this paper, we propose a
   framework based mostly on contextual data and other parameters of COPD
   as put forth by the World Health Organization (WHO) in the form of the
   International Classification of Functioning, Disability, and Health.
   Ontologies drive this architecture and incorporate dynamic contextual
   information from patient environments, user profiles, and sensor data.
   In addition to the various obvious data items like patient personal
   details (gender, contact, medical history) and COPD risks and symptoms,
   the COPD ontology also considers the details about the caregiver and
   healthcare professional. This is in addition to the contextual data
   processed separately using the Context Ontology. The ontology we
   constructed using Protege serves as the framework for the structured
   representation and logical inference of contextual information. By
   harnessing dynamic contextual data, our ontology enables real -time
   decision-making tailored to individual patient requirements. It empowers
   healthcare professionals to make informed choices and deliver timely
   interventions, enhancing healthcare services by offering proactive care
   to detect early signs of health deterioration and suggest preventive
   measures. This approach improves patient experiences and optimizes
   resource allocation within the healthcare system. To uphold ethical
   standards and prioritize the needs of patients, we emphasize the
   significance of safeguarding data, obtaining informed permission, and
   recognizing data ownership. The ontologybased approach presented in this
   study offers a scalable and flexible framework that can be readily
   incorporated into existing healthcare systems, redefining the management
   of COPD in response to evolving demands. Security poses one of the
   biggest threats in context-based environments due to the different data
   formats acquired by the diverse sensors. Another essential consideration
   is confidentiality because the data in hand is sensitive patient
   information.},

   Learning: Cross-Attention Fusion of Acoustic and Semantic Features},
Journal = {IEEE ACCESS},
Year = {2025},
Volume = {13},
Pages = {56283-56295},
Abstract = {Speech Emotion Recognition has gained considerable attention in speech
   processing and machine learning due to its potential applications in
   human-computer interaction, mental health monitoring, and customer
   service. However, state-of-the-art models for speech emotion recognition
   use many parameters, which leads to computational complexity. In this
   paper, we introduce a novel deep-learning model to enhance the accuracy
   of emotional content detection in speech signals while maintaining a
   lightweight architecture compared to state-of-the-art models. The
   proposed model incorporates a feature encoder that significantly
   improves the emotional representation of acoustic features and a
   cross-attention mechanism to fuse acoustic features, such as
   Spectrograms, with semantic features extracted from the pre-trained
   self-supervised learning framework, enriching the emotional
   representation of speech. An extensive experimental study demonstrates
   that the proposed model achieves a weighted accuracy of 74.6\% on the
   IEMOCAP dataset, competitive with the state-of-the-art baselines. In
   addition, our proposed model achieves a latency of 24 milliseconds on
   moderate devices while containing up to three times fewer parameters.},

Abstract = {This study investigates the data integration of IoT-enabled sensor

   quality (IAQ) solutions to improve indoor environments, energy

   three-phase engineering approach. We present the design of a prototype
   with essential classes, which is proposed to integrate IAQ data with
   health conditions, enhancing real-time monitoring and automated decision
   making for optimal energy performance for smart buildings. Our research
   goal is to define the most essential classes, arranging them
   hierarchically to create a prototype for data computing covering IAQ,
   energy performance, and health aspects. This ontological framework,
   covering all three aspects, addresses a current research gap. Results
   demonstrate the minimum viable product with 78 classes for a smart home
   IoT system, providing tailored indoor climate control based on user
   health profiles and energy performance. This prototype represents a
   significant advancement in sustainable building and IAQ management,

Title = {Semantic representation and comparative analysis of physical activity
   sensor observations using MOX2-5 sensor in real and synthetic datasets:
   a proof-of-concept-study},
Journal = {SCIENTIFIC REPORTS},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {14},
Number = {1},
Month = {FEB 26},
Abstract = {The widespread use of devices like mobile phones and wearables allows
   for automatic monitoring of human daily activities, generating vast
   datasets that offer insights into long-term human behavior. A structured
   and controlled data collection process is essential to unlock the full
   potential of this information. While wearable sensors for physical
   activity monitoring have gained significant traction in healthcare,
   sports science, and fitness applications, securing diverse and
   comprehensive datasets for research and algorithm development poses a
   notable challenge. In this proof-of-concept study, we underscore the
   significance of semantic representation in enhancing data
   interoperability and facilitating advanced analytics for physical
   activity sensor observations. Our approach focuses on enhancing the
   usability of physical activity datasets by employing a medical-grade (CE
   certified) sensor to generate synthetic datasets. Additionally, we
   provide insights into ethical considerations related to synthetic
   datasets. The study conducts a comparative analysis between real and
   synthetic activity datasets, assessing their effectiveness in mitigating
   model bias and promoting fairness in predictive analysis. We have
   created an ontology for semantically representing observations from
   physical activity sensors and conducted predictive analysis on data
   collected using MOX2-5 activity sensors. Until now, there has been a
   lack of publicly available datasets for physical activity collected with
   MOX2-5 activity monitoring medical grade (CE certified) device. The
   MOX2-5 captures and transmits high-resolution data, including activity
   intensity, weight-bearing, sedentary, standing, low, moderate, and
   vigorous physical activity, as well as steps per minute. Our dataset
   consists of physical activity data collected from 16 adults (Male: 12;
   Female: 4) over a period of 30-45 days (approximately 1.5 months),
   yielding a relatively small volume of 539 records. To address this
   limitation, we employ various synthetic data generation methods, such as
   Gaussian Capula (GC), Conditional Tabular General Adversarial Network
   (CTGAN), and Tabular General Adversarial Network (TABGAN), to augment
   the dataset with synthetic data. For both the authentic and synthetic
   datasets, we have developed a Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) classification
   model for accurately classifying daily physical activity levels. The
   findings underscore the effectiveness of semantic ontology in semantic
   search, knowledge representation, data integration, reasoning, and
   capturing meaningful relationships between data. The analysis supports
   the hypothesis that the efficiency of predictive models improves as the
   volume of additional synthetic training data increases. Ontology and
   Generative AI hold the potential to expedite advancements in behavioral
   monitoring research. The data presented, encompassing both real MOX2-5
   and its synthetic counterpart, serves as a valuable resource for
   developing robust methods in activity type classification. Furthermore,
   it opens avenues for exploration into research directions related to
   synthetic data, including model efficiency, detection of generated data,
   and considerations regarding data privacy.},

Title = {Visual to near-infrared image translation for precision agriculture
   operations using GANs and aerial images},
Journal = {COMPUTERS AND ELECTRONICS IN AGRICULTURE},
Year = {2025},
Volume = {237},
Number = {C},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {The rapid growth of computer vision and artificial intelligence (AI)
   techniques, along with advancements in sensory systems and unmanned
   aerial vehicles (UAVs), have profoundly impacted various fields such as
   Precision Agriculture (PA). A core operation in PA for crop monitoring
   and yield improvement is the combination of visual and near-infrared
   (NIR) wavelengths using pixel-wise operations known as Vegetation
   Indices (VIs). However, deploying costly multi-spectral sensory systems
   limits the scalability of existing PA solutions. Towards this direction,
   Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) can be employed for transforming
   visual images to near-infrared representations, enabling the utilization
   of affordable off-the-shelf visual sensors and reducing system cost and
   complexity. Nevertheless, existing GAN-based methods for spectral domain
   translation often are limited to colorization models that produce
   pseudo-realistic images, neglecting the crucial spectral characteristics
   of the target domain. These synthetic images are commonly evaluated
   based on their visual plausibility rather than the spectral
   characteristic's consistency. In the context of precision agriculture,
   such translations from visual to NIR domain may lead to inaccurate VI
   calculations and unreliable vegetation health estimation, making the
   usability of the synthesized data questionable. To overcome these
   limitations, we propose a model-agnostic modification for GANs that
   leverages the semantic information of VIs in the translation process.
   Our approach introduces an additional branch to the GAN architecture,
   calculating the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) from the
   input RGB and the generated NIR image. By backpropagating the additional
   branch loss, our method enforces the network to produce meaningful NIR
   representations that accurately preserve the domain's spectral
   characteristics. We deploy our approach on two widely used GAN
   architectures, Pix2Pix and CycleGAN, and evaluate the synthesized
   results on relevant datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that the
   proposed method provides accurate and meaningful translations of visual
   to NIR images. The synthesized images maintain their semantic context
   under the near-infrared spectral attributes, making them suitable for
   precise VI calculations, vegetation health estimation, and efficient
   utilization in relative precision agriculture applications.},

Title = {Visible and thermal image fusion network with diffusion models for
   high-level visual tasks},
Journal = {APPLIED INTELLIGENCE},
Year = {2025},
Volume = {55},
Number = {4},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Fusion technology enhances the performance of applications such as
   security, autonomous driving, military surveillance, medical imaging,
   and environmental monitoring by combining complementary information. The
   fusion of visible and thermal (RGB-T) images is critical for improving
   human observation and visual tasks. However, the training of most
   semantics-driven fusion algorithms combines segmentation and fusion
   tasks, thereby increasing the computational cost and underutilizing
   semantic information. Designing a cleaner fusion architecture to mine
   rich deep semantic features is the key to addressing this issue. A
   two-stage RGB-T image fusion network with diffusion models is proposed
   in this paper. In the first stage, the diffusion model is employed to
   extract multiscale features. This provided rich semantic features and
   texture edges for the fusion network. In the next stage, semantic
   feature enhancement module (SFEM) and detail feature enhancement module
   (DFEM) are proposed to improve the network's ability to describe small
   details. An adaptive global-local attention mechanism (AGAM) is used to
   enhance the weights of key features related to visual tasks.
   Specifically, we benchmarked the proposed algorithm by creating a new
   tri-modal sensor driving scene dataset (TSDS), which includes 15234 sets
   of labeled images (visible, thermal, and polarization degree images).
   The semantic segmentation model trained on our fusion images achieved
   78.41\% accuracy, and the object detection model achieved 87.21\% MAP.
   The experimental results indicate that our algorithm outperforms the
   state-of-the-art image fusion algorithms.},

Title = {A distributed classification and prediction model using federated
   learning in healthcare},
Journal = {KNOWLEDGE AND INFORMATION SYSTEMS},
Year = {2025},
Month = {2025 JUN 30},
Abstract = {Federated learning provides a comprehensive distributed AI paradigm in
   the healthcare sector by effectively managing and ensuring the privacy
   of sensitive records through the training of multiple local models
   without requiring data sharing or access. Several research efforts have
   been made by the researchers in the FL-based AI concerns by focusing on
   the general architecture, protocols, designs, privacy issues and
   prediction of records in local data sets. Moreover, the FL applications
   needed to be incorporated into predicting and classifying medical
   records more systematically and accurately, while facilitating accurate
   decision-making. This paper has proposed an accurate decision-making and
   classification method using ontology and prediction models for handling
   the distributed medical records of patients collected by heterogeneous
   intelligent devices. The proposed mechanism ensures an accurate
   decision-making and classification method using ontology and a rational
   decision prediction model for handling the distributed medical records.
   The proposed mechanism efficiently provides accurate decision-making
   while sharing and recording the information in a heterogeneous network.
   The proposed model is further validated and experimented against
   heterogeneous data sets in terms of accuracy, prediction, and
   classification metrics compared to existing models.},

Title = {Digital twinning of building construction processes. Case study: A
   reinforced concrete cast-in structure},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF BUILDING ENGINEERING},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {84},
Month = {MAY 1},
Abstract = {This paper summarizes the findings obtained during the development of
   information pipelines between a construction site and its corresponding
   digital twin. The case study is the construction of an office building
   in which independent information pipelines can track different aspects
   of the construction process and the aggregate result can assist managers
   in decision making in the form of a vaster entity: its digital twin. The
   digital twin prototype is designed as a recipient of information that
   mirror its physical building and its systems. The paper contributes with
   a real case in which these pipelines enable continuous monitoring and
   analysis of various basic parameters during construction. With a varied
   array of sensors installed, data was collected, organized and
   transmitted through a knowledge graph-based system to the digital twin
   dashboard. A dashboard is able to allocate many sources of data (from
   sensors, images or point clouds) but also, it helps visualizing data
   analysis that could help making informed decisions about the building
   during construction. The paper emphasizes the varied nature of data in
   construction sites as well as the importance of proper data channeling
   to enable multi-purpose, effective decision-making using the digital
   twin. Overall, the paper provides a real life insight that challenges
   massive implementation of digital twins within the existing construction
   sites for an office building. It also highlights its potential to
   improve productivity, resource efficiency, health and safety in
   construction environments. For this purpose, faced bottlenecks and
   challenges require refinements, more development and further research.},

Title = {Fine-grained damage detection of cement concrete pavement based on UAV
   remote sensing image segmentation and stitching},
Journal = {MEASUREMENT},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {226},
Month = {FEB 28},
Abstract = {A hybrid model for pavement damage segmentation, stitching, and
   detection based on unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) remote-sensing pavement
   images was proposed as high-resolution panoramic images are required to
   analyze pavement damage feature parameters during the inspection
   process. Based on target recognition, active stereo vision was used to
   determine the autonomy awareness of the UAV system in the 3D structure.
   Then, incremental search strategy was employed to triangulate
   scale-invariant feature transform (SIFT) point features based on
   geometric constraints. Perspective-n-point and random sample consensus
   (PNP-RANSAC) algorithm were combined to find the best matching surface
   for mis-matching rejection, and the trigonometric function theory was
   used to fuse images. Subsequently, the semantic segmentation framework
   based on deep learning context encoder network (CE-Net) was employed to
   train suitable models to simultaneously detect and segment pavement
   damages. Finally, the stitching technique and hue, saturation, value
   (HSV) segmentation technique were combined to obtain the feature
   parameters to be detected. This method achieved fast and accurate
   stitching, feature parameter segmentation, and pavement health condition
   assessment of long-threaded pavement disease image datasets. The
   splicing accuracy rate and the global feature segmentation overlap rate
   were greater than 84\% and 80\%, respectively. The experimental data
   show that the method is able to detect full-width pavement breakage
   parameters better than existing optical sensor-based automotive or drone
   inspection methods.},

Abstract = {Human activity recognition (HAR) is an important task for health
   monitoring and lifelog applications. HAR employs wearable sensors and
   can be a low-cost and effective solution. With the increasing demand for
   HAR in recent years, greater attention must be paid to complex and
   high-level semantic behaviors. To this end, we suggest describing
   complex human activity in terms of subaction time combination and
   subaction frequency decomposition. We propose a deep learning framework
   named ``convolution and spatial long-short-term memory (CSLSTM){''} for
   complex HAR. CSLSTM consists of a downsample module and a spatial
   distribution encoding module. After processing raw sensor data
   (accelerometer, gyroscope, and magnetometer) into time-frequency
   spectrograms, the downsample module uses the residual convolution block
   to downsample and extract local texture features of frequency responses
   from the spectrogram. The spatial distribution encoding module, an LSTM
   network in the 2-D time-frequency domain, mines the time-frequency
   distribution of frequency responses. In this framework, LSTM is no
   longer used to process time series data, but to process 2-D
   time-frequency spectrogram data. We evaluate the performance of CSLSTM
   on two widely used datasets: ExtraSensory and PAMAP2. Experimental
   results demonstrate that the \$F1\$ -score of CSLSTM reaches 79.45\% and
   99.22\% on the ExtraSensory and PAMAP2 datasets, respectively.},

Abstract = {IntroductionA modern and accessible healthcare system requires digital
   innovation and connectivity. The term ``Digital health{''} covers vide
   range technologies, such as mobile health and applications, electronic
   records, telehealth and telemedicine, wearable devices, robotics,
   virtual reality and artificial intelligence.MethodsScientometrics is the
   method that we have done in this study by Cite Space and VOSviewer
   software, and the result of searching the Web of Science database in
   plain text format to perform analysis and scientometrics and create
   outputs in the form of graphs and tables in the field of digital health
   has been used in stroke rehabilitation.ResultA total of 2933 documents
   related to digital health technologies in stroke rehabilitation were
   identified by searching for the terms ``stroke rehabilitation{''} or
   ``stroke recovery{''} in the title and ``digital health{''} across all
   fields. The strongest citations related to cerebrovascular disease
   spanned from 1994 to 2007, with randomised clinical trials occurring
   almost simultaneously and ended by 2012. Consequently, stroke
   rehabilitation by virtual reality technology has obtained the most
   citations and clinical trials and as an important part of digital health
   in the future research process.ConclusionThis scientometric study offers
   insights into how digital health technology can assist stroke patients
   in self-managing their health and well-being, in addition to supporting
   integrated stroke rehabilitation. The analysis revealed that three
   themes were present: author contributors and collaboration networks,
   temporal evolution, the strongest citation explosions for digital health
   technologies in stroke rehabilitation research, and semantic analysis.
   The new technology for helping stroke patients get better is a big help
   to many people with health problems.Newer technologies are now more
   common, and more patients are using remote health care monitoring. We
   need to do more research to figure out if these digital health
   technologies work well over a long period of time.This study connects
   digital technology and stroke rehab research. It looks at different
   research areas and trends, and gives a wider view than other similar
   studies. The findings show where more research should be done and help
   researchers work together in different areas to improve our knowledge of
   stroke rehabilitation.},

Abstract = {The modern healthcare landscape is overwhelmed by data derived from
   heterogeneous IoT data sources and Electronic Health Record (EHR)
   systems. Based on the advancements in data science and Machine Learning
   (ML), an improved ability to integrate and process the so-called primary
   and secondary data fosters the provision of real-time and personalized
   decisions. In that direction, an innovative mechanism for processing and
   integrating health-related data is introduced in this article. It
   describes the details of the mechanism and its internal subcomponents
   and workflows, together with the results from its utilization,
   validation, and evaluation in a real-world scenario. It also highlights
   the potential derived from the integration of primary and secondary data
   into Holistic Health Records (HHRs) and from the utilization of advanced
   ML-based and Semantic Web techniques to improve the quality,
   reliability, and interoperability of the examined data. The viability of
   this approach is evaluated through heterogeneous healthcare datasets
   pertaining to personalized risk identification and monitoring related to
   pancreatic cancer. The key outcomes and innovations of this mechanism
   are the introduction of the HHRs, which facilitate the capturing of all
   health determinants in a harmonized way, and a holistic data ingestion
   mechanism for advanced data processing and analysis.},

Title = {ESfix: An Embedded Program Repair Tool for Effective Removal of
   Concurrency Defects},
Journal = {ENTROPY},
Year = {2025},
Volume = {27},
Number = {3},
Month = {MAR 12},
Abstract = {Embedded programs are not only inseparable from our daily lives but are
   also widely used in aerospace, medical devices, and other fields that
   require very high security and stability. The uncertainty and randomness
   of the large amount of data generated by these systems during operation
   can be quantified by entropy. Traditional repair methods for concurrency
   defects may introduce new issues such as deadlocks, original semantic
   destruction, and high performance overhead. To overcome the limitations
   of the existing methods and help developers reduce the time and effort
   spent on fixing software defects, this paper proposes ESfix, a defect
   fixing technique applied to embedded software. ESfix first utilizes the
   bug information reported by the defect detection tool to locate the
   repair region and extracts the node information corresponding to the
   defective code. Then, ESfix optimizes the interrupt disable/enable
   strategies and lock strategies to repair data race and reduce bugs in
   information transmission, thereby reducing system entropy and improving
   data certainty and reliability. Finally, ESfix repairs atomicity
   violation defects using the reordering repair strategy, reducing
   information entropy by adjusting the order of information to ensure its
   integrity and consistency. ESfix conducts semantic analysis by analyzing
   the dependency graph in the control flow graph (CFG) to ensure that no
   new defects are introduced during the repair process, and to maintain
   the efficiency and accuracy of information transmission between
   different parts of the code. We evaluate the effectiveness of repair
   strategies through information entropy, and the experimental results
   show that ESfix not only improves performance but also reduces potential
   risks and losses.},

Title = {Smoke plume detection using U-Net model: an application in the Mexican
   territory},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF APPLIED REMOTE SENSING},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {18},
Number = {4},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Forest fires are a global problem that risks human health, the
   environment, and the economy. The smoke produced by forest fires
   generates emissions of gases such as CO, CO2, NOx, and SOx, which can
   deteriorate air quality, cause respiratory diseases, and contribute
   significantly to climate change. In this concern, smoke plume detection
   becomes an essential task. In this sense, we propose a semantic
   segmentation model of smoke plumes applied to forest fires in Mexico
   using GOES-16 satellite images. To do that, first, a review of the
   images from the Advanced Baseline Imager (ABI) sensor was made, and
   also, a dataset of hand-segmented images was created to generate a
   semantic segmentation model based on deep learning. As a result of the
   first qualitative analysis of ABI images, we found that bands 1 (0.47 mu
   m), 2 (0.64 mu m), and the true color composite are the most relevant
   ones for the detection of smoke plumes because they presented the
   greatest ability to distinguish smoke plumes from the rest of the image
   effectively, at least visually. A dataset of 1061 human-segmented smoke
   plume images was generated to build and test the model. The segmentation
   model is done with a slight modification of a U-Net architecture; this
   model achieved intersection over union metrics of 0.8252, Dice
   coefficient of 0.9042, and accuracy of 0.9898 on the test set. The
   results demonstrate that developing and generating a smoke plume
   semantic segmentation model using satellite images and deep learning is
   feasible. This model can be used to monitor and detect forest fires from
   space, improving the management of these disasters. (c) 2024 Society of

Abstract = {Point clouds (PCs) are ubiquitous data representation schemas in complex
   tasks related to semantic segmentation and scene understanding. Contrary
   to vision-based approaches, radars, being a privacy-preserving sensor,
   are lately getting huge attention in generating PCs for medical
   applications since such sensors can be embedded into hospitals and
   living spaces. This article summarizes the use of radar-generated PCs in
   the healthcare and assisted living domain. Comparative analysis of radar
   and other technologies is presented briefly, followed by a detailed note
   on commercial radars for PC generation. Radar PC data collection,
   preprocessing, feature extractions, and feature processing are reviewed,
   and a detailed summary of applications related to healthcare and
   assisted living is presented. Supporting signal processing and machine
   learning (ML) approaches are also reviewed. Specifically, the dedicated
   PC-oriented ML algorithms are discussed in detail. The discussed
   applications encompass human activity recognition (HAR), posture
   classification, gait recognition, and fall detection. Radar PC data are
   crucial for certain health monitoring and rehabilitation tasks, such as
   skeletal-joint and pose estimation; the range, Doppler, and angle
   information of the target independently may fall short in such
   applications. Finally, this article concludes with a comprehensive
   summary of current trends, key takeaways, and future directions. This
   article also outlines the future prospect of using generative ML for
   healthcare applications.},

Title = {3D vision technologies for a self-developed structural external crack
   damage recognition robot},
Journal = {AUTOMATION IN CONSTRUCTION},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {159},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Persistent cracking and progressive damage can weaken the operational
   performance of structures such as bridges, dams, and concrete buildings.
   Consequently, research into automated, high-precision crack detection
   methods remains pivotal within the realm of structural health monitoring
   (SHM). Presently, scholars predominantly rely on two-dimensional (2D)
   image-based algorithms for crack detection. However, these methods
   commonly struggle to accurately locate the three-dimensional (3D)
   coordinates of cracks on large structures and to extract the 3D contours
   of cracks. To address this challenge, this study proposes an automated
   3D crack detection system for structures based on high-precision Light
   Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) and camera fusion. Firstly, precise
   registration of images and LiDAR point clouds was achieved through
   accurate extrinsic calibration of the sensors. Secondly, the lightweight
   MobileNetV2\_DeepLabV3 crack semantic segmentation network was employed
   to detect and locate cracks. Finally, by automatically guiding the
   robotic arm, an industry-standard depth camera was able to capture
   high-precision 3D information about the crack at close observation
   points. Compared with the existing studies, this study emphasizes the
   extraction of high-precision 3D crack features and verifies the validity
   of the method by comparing the measurement results with those of the
   traditional method, demonstrating a remarkable measurement accuracy
   reaching sub-millimeter levels (0.1 mm). Moreover, the study introduces
   a comprehensive hardware platform and algorithmic framework, offering
   pioneering theoretical methodologies and replicable equipment references
   for automated surveillance and monitoring systems dedicated to
   structural health.},

Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PATTERN RECOGNITION AND ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE},
Year = {2025},

Abstract = {Human Activity Recognition (HAR) is pivotal in ubiquitous computing,
   offering benefits to human-centric services such as health monitoring,
   smart homes, and eldercare systems. HAR leverages smartphones,
   smartwatches, and other wearable devices to collect sensory data
   annotated with activity labels, which are then used to train machine
   learning or deep learning models for automatic activity recognition.
   Effective HAR systems must integrate information from multiple
   modalities to accurately assist users. This paper introduces the
   XAttentionHAR model, an innovative cross-modality attention-based
   ensemble model for HAR. Our approach utilizes a self-attention module to
   extract features within each modality and an inter-domain
   cross-attention module to capture and integrate long-term dependencies
   across domains. The cross-modality attention mechanism enhances the
   fusion of diverse modalities, enriching the semantic information. We
   conducted extensive experiments on the WISDM public dataset, which
   includes accelerometer and gyroscope data from smartwatches and
   smartphones. Our results demonstrate that XAttentionHAR outperforms
   other state-of-the-art methods in activity recognition, achieving
   98.48\% accuracy for smartphone-based HAR and 98.73\% accuracy for
   smartwatch-based HAR, paving the way for improved human-centric

Pages = {362-375},
Abstract = {Sensorimotor embodiment of emotional semantic representations in the
   second language (L2) has been largely studied through behavioral
   paradigms. However, most neuroscience research of embodied semantics has
   almost exclusively focused on the native language (L1). The
   representational architecture of emotive concepts (e.g., love, hate) in
   L2 has been explored from the neurocognitive perspective to a lesser
   degree. In this review, we first scrutinize emotive concepts
   highlighting their main embodied features and differences from other
   abstract (e.g., transformation, coherence) and concrete (e.g., hat, cat)
   concepts. We then analyse conceptualization of lexicosemantic
   representations indicating that L2 proficiency plays out differently in
   the development of embodied features for L2 emotive lexicon. Second, we
   examine behavioral research in the emotive concepts' domain both in
   exclusively L1 and in mono-and bilingual contexts. We then summarize the
   main neurocognitive evidence in processing emotive semantics in L1.
   Finally, we review the existing neurocognitive findings regarding
   embodied processing of emotive concepts in L2. Thus, we discuss evidence
   from several recent neuroimaging (i.e., fMRI, EEG), and physiological
   (i.e., EML, eye-tracking) studies using healthy populations. These data
   provide evidence for the existence of embodied neural representations of
   emotive concepts in L2. However, these findings also suggest they are
   embodied differently than L1 words to a degree.},

Title = {A Software-Defined Sensor System Using Semantic Segmentation for
   Monitoring Remaining Intravenous Fluids},
Journal = {SENSORS},
Year = {2025},
Volume = {25},
Number = {10},
Month = {MAY 13},
Abstract = {Accurate intravenous (IV) fluid monitoring is critical in healthcare to
   prevent infusion errors and ensure patient safety. Traditional
   monitoring methods often depend on dedicated hardware, such as weight
   sensors or optical systems, which can be costly, complex, and
   challenging to scale across diverse clinical settings. This study
   introduces a software-defined sensing approach that leverages semantic
   segmentation using the pyramid scene parsing network (PSPNet) to
   estimate the remaining IV fluid volumes directly from images captured by
   standard smartphones. The system identifies the IV container (vessel)
   and its fluid content (liquid) using pixel-level segmentation and
   estimates the remaining fluid volume without requiring physical sensors.
   Trained on a custom IV-specific image dataset, the proposed model
   achieved high accuracy with mean intersection over union (mIoU) scores
   of 0.94 for the vessel and 0.92 for the fluid regions. Comparative
   analysis with the segment anything model (SAM) demonstrated that the
   PSPNet-based system significantly outperformed the SAM, particularly in
   segmenting transparent fluids without requiring manual threshold tuning.
   This approach provides a scalable, cost-effective alternative to
   hardware-dependent monitoring systems and opens the door to AI-powered
   fluid sensing in smart healthcare environments. Preliminary benchmarking
   demonstrated that the system achieves near-real-time inference on mobile
   devices such as the iPhone 12, confirming its suitability for bedside
   and point-of-care use.},

Title = {Regionally specific cortical lateralization of abstract and concrete
   verb processing: Magnetic mismatch negativity study},
Journal = {NEUROPSYCHOLOGIA},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {195},
Month = {MAR 12},
Abstract = {The neural underpinnings of processing concrete and abstract semantics
   remain poorly understood. Previous fMRI studies have shown that
   multimodal and amodal neural networks respond differentially to
   different semantic types; importantly, abstract semantics activates more
   left-lateralized networks, as opposed to more bilateral activity for
   concrete words. Due to the lack of temporal resolution, these fMRI
   results do not allow to easily separate language- and task-specific
   brain responses and to disentangle early processing stages from later
   post-comprehension phenomena. To tackle this, we used
   magnetoencephalography (MEG), a time-resolved neuroimaging technique, in
   combination with a task-free oddball mismatch negativity (MMN) paradigm,
   an established approach to tracking early automatic activation of
   word-specific memory traces in the brain. We recorded the magnetic MMN
   responses in 30 healthy adults to auditorily presented abstract and
   concrete action verbs to assess lateralization of word-specific
   lexico-semantic processing in a set of neocortical areas. We found that
   MMN responses to these stimuli showed different lateralization patterns
   of activity in the upper limb motor area (BA4) and parts of Broca ` s
   area (BA45/BA47) within similar to 100-350 ms after the word
   disambiguation point. Importantly, the greater leftward response
   lateralization for abstract semantics was due to the lesser involvement
   of the right-hemispheric homologues, not increased left-hemispheric
   activity. These findings suggest differential region-specific
   involvement of bilateral sensorimotor systems already in the early
   automatic stages of processing abstract and concrete action semantics.},

Title = {Structured Data Ontology for AI in Industrial Asset Condition Monitoring},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF SENSOR AND ACTUATOR NETWORKS},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {13},
Number = {2},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {This paper proposes an ontology for prognostics and health management
   (PHM) applications involving sensor networks monitoring industrial
   machinery. Deep learning methods show promise for the development of
   autonomous PHM systems but require vast quantities of structured and
   representative data to realize their potential. PHM systems involve
   unique and specialized data characterized by time and context, and thus
   benefit from tailored data management systems. Furthermore, the use of
   dissimilar standards and practices with respect to database structure
   and data organization is a hinderance to interoperability. To address
   this, this paper presents a robust, structured data ontology and schema
   that is designed to accommodate a wide breadth of PHM applications. The
   inclusion of contextual and temporal data increases its value for
   developing and deploying enhanced ML-driven PHM systems. Challenges
   around balancing the competing priorities of structure and flexibility
   are discussed. The proposed schema provides the benefits of a relational
   schema with some provisions for noSQL-like flexibility in areas where
   PMH applications demand it. The selection of a database engine for
   implementation is also discussed, and the proposed ontology is
   demonstrated using a Postgres database. An instance of the database was
   loaded with large auto-generated fictitious data via multiple Python
   scripts. CRUD (create, read, update, delete) operations are demonstrated
   with several queries that answer common PHM questions.},

Title = {Vibration displacement measurement of bridge structural models using
   image super-resolution reconstruction and visual object detection
   network},
Journal = {MEASUREMENT SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY},
Year = {2025},
Volume = {36},

Month = {JAN 31},
Abstract = {Visual vibration measurement has emerged in the field of structural
   health monitoring in recent years, but it still has some shortcomings in
   terms of resolution, recognition rate and real-time performance.
   Considering the three aspects of recovering high-frequency image
   details, improving the compactness of the target bounding box, and
   reducing the computational time, we use the constructed image
   super-resolution reconstruction model and target detection model to
   measure the vibration displacement of the bridge structural model.
   First, we integrate the Transformer module into the Unet network with a
   simple structure. The Swin and Global Transformer Unet (SGTU) module
   constructed in this form can reduce the computational cost while
   reconstructing the large-resolution feature map target, and it can
   sharply edge information of the vibration target. We use the framework
   of the YOLOv5 algorithm as the backbone, and use the GhostBottleneck
   (GB) module to reduce the time for convolution operations to generate
   similar features. In addition, the proposed DWCBottleneck (DWCB) fusion
   module is also able to achieve high-level semantic fusion and network
   depth expansion with minimal computational cost. Finally, the center
   point offset of the bounding box predicted by the model can be used to
   obtain the displacement offset of the object in the image sequence. The
   position information of the target in the first frame image is used as
   the reference frame for calculating the offset, and the vibration
   displacement of the flexible structure in the image coordinate system is
   obtained by calculating the deviation of the displacement between the
   remaining frames and the first frame. We perform qualitative and
   quantitative comparisons in three aspects: video super-resolution
   reconstruction, visual detection robustness, and sensor vibration
   measurement displacement using a homemade vibration image dataset. The
   time-frequency domain displacement curves regressed by the visual
   vibration measurement algorithm are compared with the curves acquired
   after accelerometer acquisition, indicating the necessity of
   super-resolution reconstruction in visual vibration measurement.},

Title = {Health \& Gait: a dataset for gait-based analysis},
Journal = {SCIENTIFIC DATA},
Year = {2025},
Volume = {12},
Number = {1},
Month = {JAN 10},
Abstract = {Acquiring gait metrics and anthropometric data is crucial for evaluating
   an individual's physical status. Automating this assessment process
   alleviates the burden on healthcare professionals and accelerates
   patient monitoring. Current automation techniques depend on specific,
   expensive systems such as OptoGait or MuscleLAB, which necessitate
   training and physical space. A more accessible alternative could be
   artificial vision systems that are operable via mobile devices. This
   article introduces Health\&Gait, the first dataset for video-based gait
   analysis, comprising 398 participants and 1, 564 videos. The dataset
   provides information such as the participant's silhouette, semantic
   segmentation, optical flow, and human pose. Furthermore, each
   participant's data includes their sex, anthropometric measurements like
   height and weight, and gait parameters such as step or stride length and
   gait speed. The technical evaluation demonstrates the utility of the
   information extracted from the videos and the gait parameters in
   tackling tasks like sex classification and regression of weight and age.
   Health\&Gait facilitates the progression of artificial vision algorithms
   for automated gait analysis.},

Abstract = {M \& amacr;ori agribusiness collectives (MACs) and iwi (tribal entities)
   in Aotearoa New Zealand (AoNZ) are increasingly focused on enhancing
   their environmental intelligence capabilities. With advancements in
   environmental sensing technologies, artificial intelligence (AI), and
   data warehousing, it has become feasible for MACs and iwi to establish
   their own environmental sensor networks (ESNs). In response to this
   interest, the Kaitiaki Intelligence Platform project was launched to
   design an Indigenous ESN. This paper examines the types of environmental
   data that MAC and iwi partners aim to capture with an ESN, as well as
   their preferences for data structure, querying, and communication. The
   findings indicate that these partners seek to collect a wide range of
   biophysical data using both remote and in-situ sensing technologies,
   combined with Place-based intelligence informed by m \& amacr;tauranga
   (M \& amacr;ori knowledge/knowledge system). They prefer to structure
   data using M \& amacr;ori environmental ontologies and apply m \&
   amacr;tauranga to train AI systems that can identify environmental
   health indicators and model the balance between human and non-human
   environmental persons. Data communication is favoured through relational
   kin-centric metaphors, reflecting a culturally sensitive approach to
   environmental monitoring. Furthermore, the need for layered data
   security is emphasised to uphold Indigenous data sovereignty principles.},

Title = {Crop health assessment through hierarchical fuzzy rule-based status maps},

Abstract = {Precision agriculture is evolving toward a contemporary approach that
   involves multiple sensing techniques to monitor and enhance crop quality
   while minimizing losses and waste of no longer considered inexhaustible
   resources, such as soil and water supplies. To understand crop status,
   it is necessary to integrate data from heterogeneous sensors and employ
   advanced sensing devices that can assess crop and water status. This
   study presents a smart monitoring approach in agriculture, involving
   sensors that can be both stationary (such as soil moisture sensors) and
   mobile (such as sensor-equipped unmanned aerial vehicles). These sensors
   collect information from visual maps of crop production and water
   conditions, to comprehensively understand the crop area and spot any
   potential vegetation problems. A modular fuzzy control scheme has been
   designed to interpret spectral indices and vegetative parameters and, by
   applying fuzzy rules, return status maps about vegetation status. The
   rules are applied incrementally per a hierarchical design to correlate
   lower-level data (e.g., temperature, vegetation indices) with
   higher-level data (e.g., vapor pressure deficit) to robustly determine
   the vegetation status and the main parameters that have led to it. A
   case study was conducted, involving the collection of satellite images
   from artichoke crops in Salerno, Italy, to demonstrate the potential of
   incremental design and information integration in crop health
   monitoring. Subsequently, tests were conducted on vineyard regions of
   interest in Teano, Italy, to assess the efficacy of the framework in the
   assessment of plant status and water stress. Indeed, comparing the
   outcomes of our maps with those of cutting-edge machine learning (ML)
   semantic segmentation has indeed revealed a promising level of accuracy.
   Specifically, classification performance was compared to the output of
   conventional ML methods, demonstrating that our approach is consistent
   and achieves an accuracy of over 90\% throughout various seasons of the
   year.},

Title = {Adaptive Vibration Monitoring of Railway Track Structures Using the
   UWFBG by the Identification of Train-Load Patterns},
Journal = {BUILDINGS},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {14},
Number = {5},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Due to the capability of multiplexing thousands of sensors on a single
   optical cable, ultra-weak fiber Bragg grating (UWFBG) vibration sensing
   technology has been utilized in monitoring the vibration response of
   large-scale infrastructures, particularly urban railway tracks, and the
   volume of the collected monitoring data can be huge with the great
   number of sensors. Even though the train-induced vibration responses of
   urban railway tracks constitute the most informative and crucial
   component, they comprised less than 7\% of the total operational period.
   This is mainly attributed to the temporal sparsity of commuting trains.
   Consequently, the majority of the stored data consisted of
   low-informative environmental noise and interference excitation data,
   leading to an inefficient structural health monitoring (SHM) system. To
   address this issue, this paper introduced an adaptive monitoring
   strategy for railway track structures, which is capable of identifying
   train-load patterns by leveraging deep learning techniques. Inspired by
   image semantic segmentation, a U-net model with one-dimensional
   convolution layers (U-net-1D) was developed for the pointwise
   classification of vibration monitoring data. The proposed model was
   trained and validated using a dataset obtained from an actual urban
   railway track in China. Results indicated that the proposed method
   outperforms the traditional dual-threshold method, achieving an
   Intersection over Union (IoU) of 94.27\% on the segmentation task of the
   test dataset.},

Abstract = {Given the persistent global challenge presented by rapidly spreading
   diseases, as evidenced notably by the widespread impact of the COVID-19
   pandemic on both human health and economies worldwide, the necessity of
   developing effective infectious disease prediction models has become of
   utmost importance. In this context, the utilization of online social
   media platforms as valuable tools in healthcare settings has gained
   prominence, offering direct avenues for disseminating critical health
   information to the public in a timely and accessible manner. Propelled
   by the ubiquitous accessibility of the internet through computers and
   mobile devices, these platforms promise to revolutionize traditional
   detection methods, providing more immediate and reliable epidemiological
   insights. Leveraging this paradigm shift, our proposed framework
   harnesses Twitter data associated with infectious disease symptoms,
   employing ontology to identify and curate relevant tweets. Central to
   our methodology is a hybrid model that integrates XGBoost and
   Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (BiLSTM) architectures. The
   integration of XGBoost addresses the challenge of handling small dataset
   sizes, inherent during outbreaks due to limited time series data.
   XGBoost serves as a cornerstone for minimizing the loss function and
   identifying optimal features from our multivariate time series data.
   Subsequently, the combined dataset, comprising original features and
   predicted values by XGBoost, is channeled into the BiLSTM for further
   processing. Through extensive experimentation with a dataset spanning
   multiple infectious disease outbreaks, our hybrid model demonstrates
   superior predictive performance compared to state-of-the-art and
   baseline models. By enhancing forecasting accuracy and outbreak tracking
   capabilities, our model offers promising prospects for assisting health
   authorities in mitigating fatalities and proactively preparing for
   potential outbreaks.},

Title = {Design of a Wearable Exoskeleton Piano Practice Aid Based on

Abstract = {This study designs and develops a wearable exoskeleton piano assistance
   system for individuals recovering from neurological injuries, aiming to
   help users regain the ability to perform complex tasks such as playing
   the piano. While soft robotic exoskeletons have proven effective in
   rehabilitation therapy and daily activity assistance, challenges remain
   in performing highly dexterous tasks due to structural complexity and
   insufficient motion accuracy. To address these issues, we developed a
   modular division method based on multi-domain mapping and a top-down
   process model. This method integrates the functional domain, structural
   domain, and user needs domain, and explores the principles and methods
   for creating functional construction modules, overcoming the limitations
   of traditional top-down approaches in design flexibility. By closely
   combining layout constraints with the design model, this method
   significantly improves the accuracy and efficiency of module
   configuration, offering a new path for the development of piano practice
   assistance devices. The results demonstrate that this device
   innovatively combines piano practice with rehabilitation training and
   through the introduction of ontological modeling methods, resolves the
   challenges of multidimensional needs mapping. Based on five user
   requirements (P), we calculated the corresponding demand weight (K),
   making the design more aligned with user needs. The device excels in
   enhancing motion accuracy, interactivity, and comfort, filling the gap
   in traditional piano assistance devices in terms of multi-functionality
   and high adaptability, and offering new ideas for the design and
   promotion of intelligent assistive devices. Simulation analysis,
   combined with the motion trajectory of the finger's proximal joint,
   calculates that 60 degrees is the maximum bending angle for the
   aforementioned joint. Physical validation confirms the device's superior
   performance in terms of reliability and high-precision motion
   reproduction, meeting the requirements for piano-assisted training.
   Through multi-domain mapping, the top-down process model, and modular
   design, this research effectively breaks through the design flexibility
   and functional adaptability bottleneck of traditional piano assistance
   devices while integrating neurological rehabilitation with music
   education, opening up a new application path for intelligent assistive
   devices in the fields of rehabilitation medicine and arts education, and
   providing a solution for cross-disciplinary technology fusion and
   innovative development.},

Abstract = {Smart wearable devices detection and recording of people's everyday
   activities is critical for health monitoring, helping persons with
   disabilities, and providing care for the elderly. Most of the research
   that is being conducted uses a machine learning-based methodology;
   however, these approaches frequently have issues with high computing
   resource consumption, burdensome training data gathering, and restricted
   scalability across many contexts. This research suggests a behaviour
   detection technology based on multi-source sensing and logical reasoning
   to address these problems. In order to realize the natural fusion of
   signal processing and logical reasoning in behavior recognition
   research, this work designs a lightweight behavior recognition solution
   using the pertinent theories of ontology reasoning in classical
   artificial intelligence. Machine learning technology is also employed
   for behavior recognition using the same data set. Once the best model
   has been chosen, the cross-person recognition results after testing and
   modification of parameters are 90.8\% and 92.1\%, respectively. This
   technology was used to create a behaviour recognition system, and
   several tests were run to assess how well it worked. The findings
   demonstrate that the suggested strategy achieves over 90\% recognition
   accuracy for 11 different daily activities, including jogging, walking,
   and stair climbing. Additionally, the suggested strategy dramatically
   minimises the quantity of user-provided training data needed in
   comparison to machine learning-based behaviour identification
   techniques.},

Title = {Transcriptional reprogramming post-peripheral nerve injury: A systematic
   review},
Journal = {NEUROBIOLOGY OF DISEASE},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {200},
Month = {OCT 1},
Abstract = {Neuropathic pain is characterised by periodic or continuous
   hyperalgesia, numbness, or allodynia, and results from insults to the
   somatosensory nervous system. Peripheral nerve injury induces
   transcriptional reprogramming in peripheral sensory neurons,
   contributing to increased spinal nociceptive input and the development
   of neuropathic pain. Effective treatment for neuropathic pain remains an
   unmet medical need as current therapeutics offer limited effectiveness
   and have undesirable effects. Understanding transcriptional changes in
   peripheral nerve injury-induced neuropathy might offer a path for novel
   analgesics. Our literature search identified 65 papers exploring
   transcriptomic changes post-peripheral nerve injury, many of which were
   conducted in animal models. We scrutinize their transcriptional changes
   data and conduct gene ontology enrichment analysis to reveal their
   common functional profile. Focusing on genes involved in `sensory
   perception of pain' (GO:0019233), we identified transcriptional changes
   for different ion channels, receptors, and neurotransmitters, shedding
   light on its role in nociception. Examining peripheral sensory neurons
   subtype-specific transcriptional reprograming and
   regeneration-associated genes, we delved into downstream regulation of
   hypersensitivity. Identifying the temporal program of transcription
   regulatory mechanisms might help develop better therapeutics to target
   them effectively and selectively, thus preventing the development of
   neuropathic pain without affecting other physiological functions.},

Title = {Adaptation and validation of the Chinese version of the digital
   addiction scale for children (DASC)},

Abstract = {Background With more than 90\% penetration of personal digital devices,
   digital addiction in children has emerged as a significant concern in
   China. Environmental and socioeconomic stressors in China-a highly
   collectivist society-may contribute to a higher prevalence of digital
   addiction. However, there is a lack of culturally adapted tools to
   assess digital addiction among children in China. Objectives This study
   aimed to: (1) linguistically and culturally adapt the Digital Addiction
   Scale for Children (DASC) to the Chinese context; (2) examine its
   psychometric properties, including validity (i.e., construct and
   convergent validity) and reliability (i.e., internal consistency and
   test-retest reliability); and (3) establish a potential cut-off score
   for identifying children at risk of digital addiction. Methods The DASC
   was translated into Chinese and adapted following forward translation,
   back translation, harmonization and pilot testing with 24 students in
   grades four to eight to ensure conceptual and semantic equivalence,
   clarity and cultural relevance. The final Chinese DASC consists of 24
   items after excluding item 11. This study employed a cross-sectional
   design to validate the Chinese version of the DASC. Based on convenience
   sampling, Nanling County in Anhui Province, China was selected as the
   study site. Six schools were then chosen using a stratified randomised
   cluster sampling method, with three strata: urban, peri-urban, and rural
   areas. Given the feasibility of completing questionnaires independently,
   students in grades five to eight (aged 12-16 years old) from primary and
   secondary schools were invited. One class of students in each grade in
   each selected school was randomly invited to participate. To assess the
   psychometric properties of the DASC, both exploratory factor analysis
   (EFA) and confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) were conducted using SPSS
   30.0 and AMOS 28.0, respectively. Convergent validity was evaluated
   using Pearson correlation coefficients between the DASC and Young's
   Internet Addiction Test (IAT). Reliability was assessed using Cronbach's
   alpha for internal consistency, split-half reliability, and test-retest
   reliability over a two-week interval. Receiver operating characteristic
   (ROC) curve analysis was conducted to determine the optimal cut-off
   score, using the IAT as a reference criterion for identifying at-risk
   individuals. Results After forward translation, back translation,
   harmonization and pilot testing, the English version of the DASC was
   adapted into Chinese. In total, 592 students (age 12.8 +/- 1.7 years;
   285 girls and 307 boys) participated in the validation study. The
   24-item Chinese version of DASC was validated, with item 11 excluded due
   to cross-loading. Two components (i.e., interpersonal and intrapersonal
   dimensions) were identified for the Chinese version of the DASC based on
   exploratory and confirmatory factor analysis (RMSEA = 0.06, CFI = 0.94).
   The interpersonal dimension includes 19 items related to conflict,
   problems, displacement, deception, withdrawal and relapse. The
   intrapersonal dimension comprises 5 items related to mood modification
   and the perceived importance of digital devices. The DASC demonstrated
   acceptable convergent validity (r = 0.83 {[}95\% confidence interval
   (CI) 0.80, 0.85], p < 0.001), internal consistency reliability
   (Cronbach's alpha 0.95; split-half reliability coefficient 0.885) and
   test-retest reliability (intraclass correlation coefficient = 0.71
   (0.67, 0.75), p < 0.001).
   Using the IAT as the criterion, the suggested cut-off score for the risk
   of digital addiction was 53, yielding a sensitivity of 85.9\% and
   specificity of 92.3\%. Conclusion The linguistically and culturally
   adapted Chinese version of the DASC is a reliable and valid instrument,
   with an established cut-off score for identifying at-risk individuals.
   However, the results are limited by the use of a single-county sample,
   the exclusion of younger children (grade 4 and below) and those with
   cognitive or reading difficulties, and reliance on self-reported data.
   When appropriately generalized, the Chinese version of the DASC has
   potential applications in routine school mental health screening,
   paediatric check-ups to identify at-risk children and national health
   surveys. Tracking and understanding digital addiction using the DASC
   enables the development of evidence-based interventions and supports
   policy recommendations to address digital addiction.},
